But his career before becoming host of the show was quite an interesting and long one. Letterman was born in Broad Ripple, a neighborhood in Indianapolis. His childhood was relatively unremarkable, but he exhibited tendencies of the class clown and showed a very strong independent streak as a child. Letterman went on to graduate from Ball State University in the late 1960s and married Michelle Cook in 1969. From 1970 to 1974, he worked as a weatherman and TV announcer and from 1974 to 1975 as a radio talk show host.  As the late 1970s approached, Letterman was working as a struggling stand-up comic at The Comedy Store and started writing for television shows. He wrote for the summer series The Peeping Times and for such shows as _Good Times (1974)_ (qv). Letterman had become something of a minor celebrity by 1978, by which time he had appeared on _The Gong Show (1976)_ (qv), 'Mary Tyler Moore' (qv)'s variety series, _Mary (1978)_ (qv), _Liar's Club (1976)_ (qv), _The $10,000 Pyramid (1973)_ (qv), _Password Plus (1979)_ (qv) and the variety series, _The Starland Vocal Band Show (1977)_ (qv). (It was also revealed on the Game Show Network that Letterman hosted a pilot of a game show in the seventies called _The Riddlers (1977) (TV)_ (qv), but it was not made into a series.)  This exposure prompted many appearances on _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)_ (qv). He became so popular that he was permanent substitute host by the end of the 1970s. NBC saw great potential in the young irreverent comedian, so they gave Letterman his own daytime talk show, _The David Letterman Show (1980)_ (qv), which was a disaster and aired for only a few months. At about this time, 'Tom Snyder (I)' (qv) was having problems with his late-night show, _The Tomorrow Show (1973)_ (qv), which aired after the Tonight Show. His problems were mostly with his co-host, 'Rona Barrett' (qv), and Snyder was forced off air in late 1981. Letterman, who was still permanent co-host of the Tonight Show, took over the post-Carson slot with _Late Night with David Letterman (1982)_ (qv).  Letterman's show was extremely unconventional. For starters, Letterman was very political, whereas 'Johnny Carson (I)' (qv) had steered away from political jokes. Letterman's early antics changed talk shows. He would often stage elevator races in Radio City Music Hall. He made random calls to strangers and talked about the strangest subjects. At one point, Letterman got his associate Larry Bud Melman to stand outside the Russian Embassy and hand out pamphlets encouraging defection. He often made his guests feel uncomfortable with his intelligent and abrasive style, and guests often participated in funny and unusual skits with him. Letterman became almost an instant success, and some say he surpassed Carson in popularity.  As the late 1980s approached, Letterman was becoming more and more of a household name, often at odds with the censors over his show, and never one to kowtow to guests' wishes. But that only made him more popular, and he garnered more and more status as a world class talk show host. Among the more classic moments in his early show was the time he covered his suit with Alka Seltzer and jumped in a vat of water. Letterman helped 'Andy Kaufman (I)' (qv) with his wrestling saga, as Kaufman and 'Jerry Lawler' (qv) pretended to get in a fight on Late Night. Letterman also became known for his on-screen reclusiveness with respect to other shows. While Carson at one point in his career would often make cameos and guest appearances, Letterman would shy away from cameos and stuck almost solely to doing his Late Night show.  In 1992 'Johnny Carson (I)' (qv) made a landmark announcement: he was retiring. Many thought that Letterman would be the natural choice as Carson's replacement, but many at NBC were leaning toward current Tonight Show substitute host 'Jay Leno' (qv). The battle was very public and very vicious, but in the end Leno won out, and Letterman continued hosting the post-Tonight Show slot. But, in 1993, Letterman made his own big announcement: he was leaving NBC for a lucrative contract with CBS to star in the _Late Show with David Letterman (1993)_ (qv). The battle intensified even more. NBC claimed that many of Letterman's gimmicks and jokes, including throwing the pencil at the camera, the Top Ten List, and Larry Bud Melman, among many others, were NBC's intellectual property. NBC lost, but Larry Bud Melman would now be called by his real name, 'Calvert DeForest' (qv), on the CBS show. Competing in the late night wars with not only Leno but also 'Chevy Chase' (qv), 'Arsenio Hall' (qv) and 'Ted Koppel' (qv), Letterman consistently won over all of his competition until the summer of 1995, when Leno had guest 'Hugh Grant (I)' (qv) on his show to discuss his highly publicized arrest for being caught with prostitute 'Divine Brown (I)' (qv) and Grant cried on screen. The ratings were tremendous, and Leno has consistently beaten Letterman ever since.  In recent years, Letterman has toned down his act. He dresses more conservatively and tends to go the more traditional route of talk shows. It can be said that every talk show since, including 'Craig Kilborn' (qv) and especially 'Conan O'Brien', has been influenced a great deal by Letterman's unconventional, irreverent, off-the-wall style. It was thought that Letterman was going to retire in the mid-'90s, but an impressive $14 million-per-year deal has kept Letterman with CBS. Near-tragedy struck, however, in January of 2000 when Letterman was diagnosed with coronary arterial blockage and underwent quintuple bypass surgery. The operation was successful, however, and Letterman received countless get-well cards and a great deal of publicity. Among David's better-known incidents in recent years have been 'Drew Barrymore (I)' (qv)'s infamous table dance, an interview with a bizarre and ditzy 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv), his appearance in the movie, _Cabin Boy (1994)_ (qv) (written by and starring his former Late Night writer and performer 'Chris Elliott (I)' (qv)), his stint as host of _The 67th Annual Academy Awards (1995) (TV)_ (qv), and his appearance in the 'Andy Kaufman (I)' (qv) biopic, _Man on the Moon (1999)_ (qv). When _Politically Incorrect (1993)_ (qv) was canceled in 2002, Letterman was sought after to leave CBS for ABC, but he declined to do so and stayed with CBS, where he remained until his retirement in May 2015.  Aside from being a talk show host, Letterman is an active producer. His production company is called Worldwide Pants. Over the years he has been executive producer of his original show, his new show, _Everybody Loves Raymond (1996)_ (qv), _The Building (1993)_ (qv), _The Bonnie Hunt Show (1995)_ (qv), _The High Life (1996)_ (qv), _The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn (1999)_ (qv), and _Ed (2000)_ (qv)."], "birthnotes": ["Indianapolis, Indiana, USA"], "birthdate": ["12 April 1947"], "height": ["6' 2"], "spouse": ["'Regina Lasko' (qv) (19 March 2009 - present); 1 child", "'Michelle Cook' (2 July 1968 - 13 October 1978) (divorced)"], "otherworks": ["(1989) Foreword to book Daddy's Boy: A Son's Shocking Account of Life with a Famous Father by 'Chris Elliott (I)' (qv) and 'Bob Elliott (I)' (qv).

Bell' (qv) who created of the most popular daytime dramas ever. After graduating from the Chicago Latin School, Bradley Bell attended the University of Colorado at Boulder, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and concluded his studies at UCLA, majoring in television production.  Beginning in 1984 Bradley Bell started his career in writing. Taught by his father and serving as an unofficial member of the writing staff of _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv) writing breakdowns and scripts, Bell was integral in the creation and launch of _The Bold and the Beautiful (1987)_ (qv). After serving on the writing team since the first episode, Bell was promoted to associate producer in 1989 and again to supervising producer in 1992. He took the reins from his father and became head writer in 1993 - after an extended 6-month trial co-written by his dad in 1992 - and then executive producer in 1995. He has remained in those positions ever since - amassing to one of the longest tenures in television. It wasn't until 2000 that Bradley Bell received his first Daytime Emmy Award nomination. By 2015, he has been awarded with three Emmys (2010, 2013, 2015) for his writing amongst 11 nominations and took home three statues for helming the Best Drama Series in a record three consecutive years (2009, 2010, 2011) amongst 9 nominations in addition to two Emmy wins in other categories.  Under Bell's leadership, The Bold And The Beautiful vaulted from the sixth-rated daytime drama to the third-ranked series during the 1992-1993 season. Today, the show is firmly established as the second-highest-ranked daytime serial only behind its sister show The Young and the Restless in the United States amassing now-stable viewership numbers of around 4 million viewers every day. The show continues to be a worldwide phenomenon in such diverse markets as Italy, Australia or South Africa. Bell has continued with his father's tradition of story-telling whilst adding an edge and glamor to his show as writer and kept an extremely stable production and behind-the-scenes-staff resulting in a stunning 21st century look with regular locations shoots (around the globe) and permanent outdoors sets on the studio-lot on a very much stream-lined filming schedule. On January 14, 2015 CBS Television City, celebrating 7000 episodes of The Bold and The Beautiful, dedicated Studio 31 - home of the show since it's inception in 1987 - to Bell in honor of his work.

Not only is it the highest-rated daytime game show, it's also the longest-running game show in TV history, surpassing the prime-time hit _What's My Line? (1950)_ (qv), which ran for 18 years. He also served the show's executive producer since 1987. Named the most popular game show host of all time in a national poll, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Daytime Television in 1999. Although he has graced our television screen for more than four decades, his career continues at full circle.  In 1996 he made his motion picture debut in Universal Pictures' _Happy Gilmore (1996)_ (qv), in which he played himself with 'Adam Sandler (I)' (qv). His real acting debut, however, came when he was asked to play 'Mel Harris (I)' (qv)' father in NBC's _Something So Right (1996)_ (qv). Another honor came when one of the most historic sites in the history of television, Stage 33 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, was re-dedicated as the Bob Barker Studio in ceremonies following the taping of the 5,000th episode of The Price is Right, on March 11, 1998. Barker is the first performer to whom CBS has ever dedicated a stage.  Barker was born in Darrington, WA, and spent most of his youth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where his mother was a schoolteacher. His family eventually moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he attended high school and Drury College on a basketball scholarship. World War II interrupted his studies and he joined the US Navy, becoming a fighter pilot, but the war ended before he was assigned to a seagoing squadron.  Following his discharge Barker returned to Drury and took a job at a local radio station to help finance his studies. It was there he discovered that what he did best was to host audience participation shows. After graduating summa cum laude with a degree in economics, he went to work for a radio station in Palm Beach, Florida. A year later he moved to Los Angeles, and within a week he was the host of his own radio program, The Bob Barker Show. He made his debut in 1956 on national television as the host of the popular _Truth or Consequences (1950)_ (qv). 'Ralph Edwards (I)' (qv), the show's originator, had sold the show to NBC as a daytime strip, but he had not chosen a host. He auditioned other hosts in Hollywood and New York for weeks, but when he heard The Bob Barker Show on his car radio, he knew he had found the man for the job. Proving that Edwards had chosen him wisely, Barker hosted Truth or Consequences for an unbelievable 18 years, and he and Edwards remain close friends to this day. They drink a toast at lunch every December 21st to celebrate the day in 1956 when Edwards notified him that he was going to become the host of Truth or Consequences.  Barker has been twice named in the Guinness Book of World Records as television's Most Durable Performer, at 3,524 shows, and Most Generous Host in Television history for awarding $55 million in prizes on his various shows. During the ensuing years the $55-million figure has increased to more than $200 million. He has won 11 Emmys as a Game Show Host, more than any other performer, and 2 more as Executive Producer of The Price is Right. He also was given the Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999, for a total of 14, and won 2 additional awards, for a total of 16 Emmys. He has also received the coveted Carbon Mike Award of the Pioneer of Broadcasters.  In 1978 he developed The Bob Barker Fun & Games Show, a series of personal appearances that attracted record-breaking audiences throughout the US and Canada. He also established the DJ&T Foundation in Beverly Hills, California, the purpose of which is to help control the dog and cat population. He is funding the foundation through his own resources to support low-cost or free spay/neuter clinics. This foundation is named in memory of his wife, Dorothy Jo, and his mother, Matilda (Tilly) Valandra, both of whom loved animals. Barker's work on behalf of animals has garnered him a long list of awards from prestigious humane organizations across the country. In fact, a columnist wrote that Bob has become a part-time television host and a full-time animal rights activist. However, he assures his audiences that there is room in his busy life for both television and animals."], "birthnotes": ["Darrington, Washington, USA"], "birthdate": ["12 December 1923"], "height": ["5' 11"], "spouse": ["'Dorothy Jo Gideon' (12 January 1945 - 19 October 1981) (her death)"], "otherworks": ["Appeared on the discussion television program Take My Advice on May 5, 1975.", "(2010-) TV commercials: State Farm Insurance Co."], "birthname": ["Barker, Robert William"], "salaryhistory": ["_The New Price Is Right (1972)_ (qv)::$10,000,000/year (2007)"], "books": ["Bob Barker with Digby Diehl. _Priceless Memories._ New York: Center Street, 2009.

Griffin was best known for creating the two most popular game shows in television syndication history, _Wheel of Fortune (1983)_ (qv) and _Jeopardy! (1984)_ (qv) that are watched by hundreds of millions of people all over the world. In the business world, he was identified as the visionary chairman of The Griffin Group.  Born in the San Francisco, California suburb of San Mateo, Griffin came up through the ranks in the classic sense, entering talent contests, writing songs, singing on local radio station KFRC-San Francisco, and later touring with 'Freddy Martin Orchestra' (qv). He became increasingly popular with nightclub audiences and his fame soared among the general public when he struck gold in 1950 with I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts, which reached the number one spot on the Hit Parade and sold three million copies.  Continuing to record hits, including Wilhelmina and Never Been Kissed, Griffin made a foray into motion pictures after 'Doris Day (I)' (qv) saw his nightclub performance and arranged a screen test for him at Warner Bros. Studios. While under contract at Warner Bros., he appeared in a number of hit movies, including _So This Is Love (1953)_ (qv) with 'Kathryn Grayson' (qv) and _The Boy from Oklahoma (1954)_ (qv) with 'Will Rogers Jr.' (qv), and 'Lon Chaney Jr.' (qv).  Television then discovered him. As a regular performer on _The Arthur Murray Party (1950)_ (qv), _Tonight Starring Jack Paar (1957)_ (qv) and others, he was offered the opportunity to host his own television series, _Play Your Hunch (1958)_ (qv). It was during this period that he conceived the idea for what was to become one of the most successful game shows in television history, _Jeopardy! (1964)_ (qv). But it was in 1962 that his career took its most dramatic turn. He became a substitute host for 'Jack Paar (I)' (qv) on _Tonight Starring Jack Paar (1957)_ (qv) and scored some of the highest ratings in the show's history. As a result, NBC gave him his own hour-long daytime talk show program, _The Merv Griffin Show (1962)_ (qv).  Griffin's name and talk show career will always be seen in the light of that of 'Johnny Carson (I)' (qv), the King of late night TV, whom he directly competed with on CBS from 1969 to 1972. Griffin's first daytime talk show began on the same day Carson first hosted _The Tonight Show (1962)_ (qv). While Carson's style was indebted to his long apprenticeship in Los Angeles in the 1950s, Griffin was based in New York, where he socialized with New York's theater and café crowds. Griffin's approach to television talk was influenced by two New York shows, 'David Susskind' (qv)'s _Open End (1958)_ (qv) and 'Mike Wallace (I)' (qv)'s _Night Beat (1956)_ (qv), and like Susskind and Wallace, he openly embraced controversial subjects. In 1965, Griffin was criticized as a traitor when he aired a special from London in which Nobel Prize-winning philosopher 'Bertrand Russell (I)' (qv) denounced the Vietnam War.  Despite his success on daytime television, it was late night that was The Holy Grail for talk show hosts. In 1969, CBS hired Griffin to directly compete with Carson in the 11:30 PM to 1:00 AM time slot that had proven a grave yard for other personalities. Not one to shy away from controversy, Griffin began to be harassed by CBS censors who objected to the antiwar statements of his guests and ordered him to feature pro-war guests for balance. The irony of the situation wasn't wasted on me, Griffin recalls in his autobiography. In 1965, I'm called a traitor by the press for presenting 'Bertrand Russell (I)' (qv), and, four years later, we are hard-pressed to find anybody to speak in favor of the Vietnam War.  In March 1970, CBS censors pixilated antiwar activist 'Abbie Hoffman' (qv) because he was wearing a shirt that resembled an American flag. The resulting blurred image meant that Hoffman's voice emanated from a jumble of lines. CBS also pressured Griffin into sacking his long-term sidekick 'Arthur Treacher' (qv), who had been his television mentor, because he was too old. The censorship did not boost the ratings for Griffin, who was facing stiff competition from the genial Carson, who himself was criticized during the era for shying away from controversial subjects.  In 1972, a fed-up Griffin negotiated a syndication deal with Metromedia to move his talk show back to the daytime in the event he was terminated by CBS. The deal was signed in secret as a penalty clause in his CBS contract gave him $1 million in the event of his being fired. Later that year, CBS terminated Griffin's late-night talk show and Griffin immediately made the transition to Metromedia's syndicated network.  While Griffin may have been a washout in late night television, his impact on daytime was immense, specifically through his production of game shows. An avid fan of puzzles since childhood, Griffin first produced a successful game show in 1964, _Jeopardy! (1964)_ (qv) for NBC. After 13 seasons as a daytime talk show host, Griffin retired from his talk show in 1986 to devote himself to producing his highly profitable game shows.  _Jeopardy! (2002)_ (qv) remains the second highest rated game show in television syndication while _Wheel of Fortune (1983)_ (qv) continues to be the longest running game show to hold the number one spot in television syndication history. Other Griffin successes in the game show field included One in a Million and 'Joe Garagiola' (qv)'s _Memory Game (1971)_ (qv), both airing on ABC, Let's Play Post Office on NBC, and _Reach for the Stars (1967)_ (qv).  In 1986, Griffin sold his production company, Merv Griffin Enterprises, to Coca-Cola's Columbia Pictures Television unit for $250 million as well as a continuing share of the profits of the shows. At that time, the transaction represented the largest acquisition of an entertainment company owned by a single individual. Subsequently, Sony Pictures Entertainment purchased Columbia and he retains the title of executive producer of both Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! (for which he still creates puzzles and questions.) He served as Executive Producer of Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus (2000).  After his retirement from daytime chat, Merv became a real estate baron, acquiring the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, which is now the venue of choice for virtually all of the Tinseltown's most high profile events such as The Golden Globe Awards, The Soap Opera Digest Awards, and The American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Awards. He also owns the Hilton Scottsdale Resort and Villas in Arizona, and St. Clerans Manor, an 18th century estate once owned by director John Huston which is located near Galway, the premier resort destination in Ireland.  In January 1998, Griffin opened The Coconut Club, one of the country's hottest swing/dance clubs, at his Beverly Hilton Hotel. This weekend venue, fashioned after Hollywood's famed Coconut Grove (where Griffin headlined as a boy singer with The Freddy Martin Orchestra) features live Big Bands, Swing Orchestras, and Disco Bands amidst a glamorous nightclub setting.  He was honored with the prestigious 1994 Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame Award, alongside such figures as 'Diane Sawyer' (qv) and 'Dan Rather' (qv). Winner of 15 Emmy Awards, Griffin was presented an Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show Emmy for 1993-1994 as executive producer of _Jeopardy! (1984)_ (qv) He had also been the recipient of the coveted Scopus Award from the American Friends of Hebrew University, The Duke Award presented by the 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) Cancer Institute, and he had been honored by the American Ireland Fund and the SHARE organization. He was Lifetime Honorary Festival Chairman of La Quinta Arts Festival and recently donated his Wickenburg Inn and Dude Ranch to Childhelp USA.

She is the daughter of 'Betty DeGeneres' (qv) (née Elizabeth Jane Pfeffer), a speech therapist, and Elliott Everett DeGeneres, an insurance agent. Her brother is musician and producer 'Vance DeGeneres' (qv). Her parents divorced when she was sixteen years old. Her mother remarried, and her new husband, salesman Roy Gruessendorf, moved the family to Atlanta, Texas.  After graduating from Atlanta High School in 1976, Ellen attended the University of New Orleans as a communication major, but she dropped out after one semester. She held a wide variety of jobs until she turned to stand-up comedy, making her bones at small clubs and coffeehouses before working her way up to emcee Clyde's Comedy Club by 1981. Her comedy was described as a distaff version of 'Bob Newhart' (qv). Beginning in the early 1980s, she toured nationally and was named the funniest person in America after winning a competition sponsored by the cable network Showtime. This led to better gigs, including her first appearance on _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)_ (qv) in 1986.  Though DeGeneres's early forays into series television were not successful (she appeared as a supporting player in two short-lived TV situation comedies in the period 1989-92, _Open House (1989)_ (qv) and _Laurie Hill (1992)_ (qv)), she scored a hit headlining her own 1994 sitcom on ABC These Friends of Mine (later renamed _Ellen (1994)_ (qv) after its first season). She made TV history in April 1997 when her character, and DeGeneres herself personally, revealed that she was a lesbian. However, the show was canceled the following season due to declining ratings, after which DeGeneres returned to the stand-up circuit. In 2001, DeGeneres launched a new series, _The Ellen Show (2001)_ (qv), on CBS, but it suffered from poor ratings and was canceled.  Redemption as a television artiste came in 2003, when DeGeneres's daytime talk show, _Ellen: The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003)_ (qv) proved to be both a critical hit and a commercial success. Along with good ratings, the show has won unprecedented kudos from the industry, winning 15 Emmy Awards in its first three seasons on the air and becoming the first talk show in TV history to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show in its first three seasons.  DeGeneres has also made a name for herself as a host of awards shows. She hosted the Grammy Awards in 1996 and 1997, as well as the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2001 and 2005. In February 2007, she had the ultimate TV awards show gig, hosting the Oscars, which she hosted again in 2014."], "birthnotes": ["Metairie, Louisiana, USA"], "birthdate": ["26 January 1958"], "height": ["5' 7 1/2"], "spouse": ["'Portia de Rossi' (qv) (16 August 2008 - present)"], "otherworks": ["(2012) Advertising Spokesperson for JC Penney.", "Music video for 'Sheryl Crow' (qv): A Change (Would Do You Good)", "(1995) Book: My Point...And I Do Have One.", "10 October 1996: Taste This (CD)", "Host of VH-1's 1998 Fashion Awards (1998).", "Hosts ExxonMobil's Universe of Energy Pavilion at Disney's EPCOT Center in Orlando, Florida along with 'Jamie Lee Curtis' (qv), 'Bill Nye' (qv) (The Science Guy) and 'Alex Trebek' (qv).", "(2004) TV commercial for American Express credit card.", "(2003) Book: The Funny Thing Is...", "(2005) Public service announcement for The ONE Campaign.", "(1987) TV commercial, US West Telecommunications (now Qwest).", "(2005) TV commercial for XM satellite radio.", "(2005) Radio commercial for XM satellite radio.", "(2005) Voiceover for American Express credit card commercials.", "TV commercial for Popeye's chicken.", "(2007) TV commercial for American Express' Members Project.", "(2007) Print ads for American Greetings' Cards By Ellen line of greeting cards.", "(2008) Print ads for Wyeth's Advil and Advil PM pain relievers and their LifeList contest.", "(2009) TV commercial for Covergirl's Simply Ageless makeup.", "(2009-12) Print ads or Covergirl/Olay's Simply Ageless makeup.", "(2010) Print ads for Glaceau's Vitamin Water Zero.", "(February 2012) TV commercial 6 AM Sale (I Love Lucy twin beds spoof) for JC Penney.", "(February 2012) TV commercial Coupons in the Old West for JC Penney.", "(2012) Print ads for Covergirl + Olay's Tone Rehab 2-in-1 Foundation.", "(2011) Book: Seriously...I'm Kidding.

However, the Oscar winning actor has always been fascinated by questions of God. To understand mankind's religious devotion, Freeman traveled to 20 cities in seven countries to some of the world's greatest religious sites as part of his National Geographic Channel six episode series, The Story of God with Morgan Freeman. There are questions that we can't answer, except with God, notes Freeman, who has said in interviews that he believes that the highest power is the human mind. Freeman narrates Through the Wormhole, a Science Channel series that explores the mysteries of existence through astrophysics, quantum mechanics and string theory. In The Story of God, Freeman, a producer on the series, asks questions like: Where do we come from? Why does evil exist? What do we mean by the apocalypse? The genesis for the series came about in the year 2000, when Freeman and producing partner Lori McCreary visited the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. The museum was originally built around 1,400 years ago as a Christian cathedral, and then in 1935 was transformed into a mosque; so some of the iconography seemed like a contradiction. McCreary said she was surprised by - to learn that Jesus was considered a prophet in the Muslim faith. I felt a little naive. I couldn't believe that I didn't know this, MeCreary explained. Morgan and I began discussing it. If we don't have a handle on this then who does? Perhaps talking about God from our differences might enlighten us all, so that we can reach a hand across the table. For the show, Freeman traveled to places like the Ganges River, Rome and the Joel Osteen Lakewood megachurch in Texas to learn about the origins of the world's five main religions: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism. Other places Freeman visited were Jerusalem's Wailing Wall, Guatemala's Mayan temples, Egypt's pyramids, Neolithic settlements in Turkey that dates to 7500 B.C., and Bodh Gaya, the holy shrine where Siddhartha had found enlightenment at the foot of the Bodhi Tree. One of the many things Freeman found interesting during his travels was how Hindus believe in reincarnation. They don't necessarily glory in that belief, said the actor. Reincarnation is a task. You have to keep at until you do it right or else you won't come back as a human and don't have to worry about it. You may be at it forever. Freeman said in some places he found answers, in others more questions. The constant through it all is that we're all looking to be part of something bigger than us, Freeman said.

Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.  Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of 'Lee Breuer' (qv)'s The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in 'Alfred Uhry' (qv)'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival's The Taming of the Shrew, opposite 'Tracey Ullman' (qv). Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with 'Frances McDormand' (qv) and 'Peter Gallagher (I)' (qv) in 'Clifford Odets' (qv)' drama The Country Girl, directed by 'Mike Nichols (I)' (qv).  Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including Easy Reader, Mel Mounds and Count Dracula on the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show _The Electric Company (1971)_ (qv). He then moved into feature film with another children's adventure, _Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971)_ (qv). Next, there was a small role in the thriller _Blade (1973)_ (qv); then he played Casca in _Julius Caesar (1979) (V)_ (qv) and the title role in _Coriolanus (1979) (V)_ (qv). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas _Attica (1980) (TV)_ (qv) and _Brubaker (1980)_ (qv), _Eyewitness (1981)_ (qv), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in _Death of a Prophet (1981) (TV)_ (qv). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in _Street Smart (1987)_ (qv) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of _Driving Miss Daisy (1989)_ (qv) opposite 'Jessica Tandy' (qv). The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful 'Matthew Broderick (I)' (qv) and fiery 'Denzel Washington' (qv) in the epic Civil War drama _Glory (1989)_ (qv) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.  His star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in _The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)_ (qv), _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991)_ (qv), and _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). Freeman's next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in 'Clint Eastwood' (qv)'s de-mythologized western _Unforgiven (1992)_ (qv). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for 'Gene Hackman' (qv), a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on _Bopha! (1993)_ (qv) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.  More strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker 'Tim Robbins (I)' (qv) in _The Shawshank Redemption (1994)_ (qv). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in _Se7en (1995)_ (qv), starred alongside 'Keanu Reeves' (qv) in _Chain Reaction (1996)_ (qv), and was pursuing another serial murderer in _Kiss the Girls (1997)_ (qv).  Further praise followed for his role in the slave tale of _Amistad (1997)_ (qv), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in _Deep Impact (1998)_ (qv), appeared in 'Neil LaBute' (qv)'s black comedy _Nurse Betty (2000)_ (qv), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in _Along Came a Spider (2001)_ (qv). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama _The Sum of All Fears (2002)_ (qv), was a military officer in the 'Stephen King (I)' (qv)-inspired _Dreamcatcher (2003)_ (qv), gave divine guidance as God to 'Jim Carrey' (qv) in _Bruce Almighty (2003)_ (qv), and played a minor role in the comedy _The Big Bounce (2004)_ (qv).  2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend 'Clint Eastwood' (qv) to appear in the drama, _Million Dollar Baby (2004)_ (qv). Freeman's on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie Scrap Iron Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer 'Hilary Swank' (qv). Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy's judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated 'Steven Spielberg' (qv)'s _War of the Worlds (2005)_ (qv) and appeared in _Batman Begins (2005)_ (qv) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of 'Christian Bale' (qv)'s Bruce Wayne/Batman for director 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv). Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.  Roles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in _Lucky Number Slevin (2006)_ (qv), a second go-round as God in _Evan Almighty (2007)_ (qv) with 'Steve Carell' (qv) taking over for 'Jim Carrey' (qv), and a supporting role in 'Ben Affleck' (qv)'s directorial debut, _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv). He co-starred with 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv) in the breakout hit _The Bucket List (2007)_ (qv) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, _Wanted (2008)_ (qv), then segued into the second Batman film, _The Dark Knight (2008)_ (qv).  In 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director's true-life drama _Invictus (2009)_ (qv), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of 'Nelson Mandela' (qv) in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics' Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.  Recently, Freeman appeared in _RED (2010)_ (qv), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the _Conan the Barbarian (2011)_ (qv) remake, starred in 'Rob Reiner' (qv)'s _The Magic of Belle Isle (2012)_ (qv); and capped the Batman trilogy with _The Dark Knight Rises (2012)_ (qv). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller _Now You See Me (2013/I)_ (qv), under the direction of 'Louis Leterrier' (qv), and the science fiction actioner _Oblivion (2013/I)_ (qv), in which he stars with 'Tom Cruise' (qv)."], "birthnotes": ["Memphis, Tennessee, USA"], "birthdate": ["1 June 1937"], "height": ["6' 2"], "spouse": ["'Myrna Colley-Lee' (16 June 1984 - 15 September 2010) (divorced)", "'Jeanette Adair Bradshaw' (22 October 1967 - 18 November 1979) (divorced); 2 children"], "otherworks": ["(1973) TV commercial for Listerine mouthwash.", "(2009) TV commercial for the 2010 Winter Olympics Visa credit card sponsor.

You can even argue debatable stereotypes, but it doesn't matter. Disney has always been there. For most of us, it's the first thing we're introduced to and that's the genius of Disney putting all their time and all their effort not in something adult, but in something for children, and once something has your childhood by the balls, it's never going to leave you. It's there forever. Disney has practically become family to us. It's fairy tales, it's magic, it's everything we enjoyed and thought was possible when we were younger, and as we grow older, there's a lot of other things to enjoy: the artistry, the creativity, the imagination.

Everyone has a story, everyone has a tragedy, everyone has made mistakes, and everyone has something incredible to share if you look close enough.

Some get uncomfortable by the fact that many don't celebrate the birth of the Christ child, but people share their joy, give to others, and express their love regardless. Christmas has evolved into something that's hard to put into words, something powerful, something joyous, something that encourages the best in others. All of these things are the focus of Christianity as well as several other religions. The power of Christmas has spread so far that people celebrate the ideals of this faith even if they don't practice the faith itself. And they celebrate it for the right reasons, because they believe people are good and can continue to be good. Christmas transcends belief, transcends details, transcends what we see as right and wrong.

Great, I'd love to see Twilight fuck that up and they do. We have sex, Vampire sex, Vampire-Teenage Human sex and it's great, it's so stupid, it's over-the- Wonderful, love it, love it, love it. Abortion? Huh? I'm gonna repeat that. Twilight, Twilight is going to talk to us about abortion. Twilight? Fucking Twi- Okay, let me give you an idea of the weight of this word, okay, I mean not even just the issue, just the fucking word. You say that word, I saw Louis Black recently and he described it as, he brought it up in his stand-up, he said: Just saying that word has clenched everybody's asshole in the audience up, everybody tightens when they hear that word. That's how hot a subject issue, okay, it's like you don't fuck around with this, okay, or if you're going to talk about it you better goddamn know what you're talking about, okay. The only people that really talk about it are either people who really know what they're talking about- let me put it this way: people who should be talking about it are either people who really know what they're talking about, or they're using it as a joke to show that they don't know what they're talking about 'cos I make jokes about abortion, you know, I've made several. But the idea is to show that, you know, the character is a moron, or using it as an analogy, you know, to press a button for shock value, you know, but we're not really going to talk about it. This is Twilight trying to talk seriously about the issue of abortion, because, as I'm not giving anything away here this is in the trailers, Bella gets pregnant and they really talk, actually I say really, they just sort of throw this shit at you about whether or not they should keep it, and in fact it's not even a discussion, it's- okay, this was my hot-button with this movie, okay, this is when I said: This film is sick. This is a disgusting, sick despicable movie.", "[on Breaking Dawn: Part 1] You gotta go over what I thought of the other movies, of course. The first Twilight, I know what you're thinking - Oh, I probably hated those movies and stuff - no, I frigging love these movies, they are beautifully bad films, they are hilarious, I loved them. Okay, the first film, you know, where they meet for the first time: pretentious girl has no problems, really over the top pale vampire that everyone in the world can tell is a vampire except for our main character, of course, is nothing like a vampire, is totally full of himself, totally pretentious, totally just- but somehow every girl's dream because he stares off and looks, you know, sad; Oh, I want him! Love it, absolutely love it. Second one, The vampire boy leaves. Aww, you know that fop was fun! But we've still got Bella and she's a bitch and she's insane and she's crazy, love it. You get this boy Jacob who's this werewolf boy, and she has some luck picking boys, and he is the only decent character that goes through these movies, he is a good boy, he is a good- he makes me hard, man, this is a nice kid, he is supportive, he makes sacrifices, he is like the perfect guy and yet somehow this dumbass broad keeps wanting the vampire. So love it, absolutely love it. Third one comes along, the third one I discussed with people, I think was trying to be a good movie and maybe had a possibly good director, but you know it takes a few shots at itself, you know, Does he ever wear a shirt? or something like that. And some of the conversations were almost kind of smart, but it's still the writing, it's still Stephanie Meyer you can't save it. So that was probably the least bad of the movies and probably the least funny though it had some good, you know, stupid scenes in it really enjoyable, I'm really loving these movies. I was hyped, frigging hyped to see this film, I couldn't wait. I saw the midnight showing, alright, I went up there and nothing but girls and boyfriends that were dragged and they just looked so miserable and it's- that's the perfect crowd to see this shit with! Sit down, the movie begins and it's just like the first one, I'm enjoying it so much the dialogue is horrendous, the things they're talking about are horrendous, it's so unrealistic, it's so playing to girls', you know, emotions and manipulating it however they want, you know, just the teenage impressionable mind, loving it.", "[on _Ed Wood (1994)_ (qv)] Everyone who wants to go into a creative medium, especially film, should definitely see this movie.", "I've gotten a lot of mileage out of that black wig.

Early on, he was writer and producer of the Award-winning documentary series Eye on New York followed by a 13 year-run in the field of children programming beginning in 1968.  Weaver was director of operations and production services for Children's Television Workshop where he was part of the original production team that created the award-winning series _Sesame Street (1969)_ (qv), _The Electric Company (1971)_ (qv), _3-2-1 Contact (1980)_ (qv) and _Feeling Good (1974)_ (qv). He also played an integral part in launching _Sesame Street (1969)_ (qv) internationally.  In 1981 Weaver moved to the West coast where he served as executive in charge of production at _The Scheme of Things (1983)_ (qv) and production manager for _Breakaway (1983)_ (qv), a syndicated magazine show before becoming writer and producer at the short-lived soap opera _Rituals (1984)_ (qv). Legendary writer and producer 'William J. Bell' (qv) then contacted Weaver whilst creating _The Bold and the Beautiful (1987)_ (qv) in the fall of 1986. Weaver served as associate producer, coordinating and senior coordinating producer before being named senior producer - only second in rank to executive producer 'Bradley Bell (I)' (qv). His responsibilities included the day-to-day management of the series as well as the supervision of international sales, operations, and promotion in which he was instrumental by making the series one of the most-watched in the world.

In 2004 he was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, an award of which he was said to have been very proud.  In May 2005, he was rushed into intensive care suffering from pneumonia, and although he appeared to be making a slow but steady recovery, doctors found that he had an infection in one of his heart valves. He was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary and underwent an operation to correct this.

After 1960, Blanc continued to work for Warner Brothers but began to work for other companies once his exclusive contract ended. He worked for Hanna-Barbera voicing characters including Barney Rubble, Dino the Dinosaur, Cosmo Spacely, Secret Squirrel, Captain Caveman, Speed Buggy, Wally Gator among others. He provided vocal effects for Tom & Jerry in the mid 1960's working with fellow Warner Bros. alum, Chuck Jones at what would become MGM Animation. In the mid 1960's, Blanc originated and voiced Toucan Sam for the Kellogg's Fruit Loops commercials.

I just really, really amused myself and my friends with memorizing entire George Carlin or Steve Martin albums, or mimicking whatever we saw on Happy Days the night before, or whatever, not realizing that kind of obsessive ability to mimic things meant that I probably had an affinity for acting. It probably wasn't until I was 16 and did a play at school. I was a rather good student... And then I did a play when I was 16 and completely lost all my concentration for academics. I didn't realize it. I just kind of became obsessed with acting, and then by the time I graduated... I did a lot of theater in college, and I knew that not many people make it, but I just figured, Well, I really want to try acting while I'm young, and I don't ever want to look back and say that I never gave it a try. I fully figured I'd be back in grad school-probably for psychology-by, say, the time I was 28. But then I tried it and got jobs like Family Ties and Growing Pains. And that gave me enough encouragement to keep going.", "(2011, on Friends) Matthew Perry was the first friend I made in Hollywood. We met when he was 17 and I was 22. We booked our first pilot together: a show called Morning Maggie, with Ellen Greene, that never saw the light of day. So I was very happy to be working with him in the middle of his huge success. That was as fun a set to be on as you might imagine, but especially back in that first year, where it was literally like being in the middle of Beatlemania. It was really fun to be in the middle of that and enjoy it while it was the phenomenon that it was. Herman's Head had just gotten canceled when Friends was first starting up, and when I read that script, I was like, Oh my God... At the time, when it was a pilot, it was called Friends Like Us, and just about everybody who read it knew it was going to be special. I mean, they didn't know it was going to be as huge as it would become, but they knew it was a really funny script that they wanted to be in. And I went and auditioned for Joey and got rejected, but-and this was the first and only time I've done this-I asked to go back in. I said, I know you said 'no' to me once, but I just want to try it again, because I like that show that much. And I went back in... And I got another very quick no. Almost as quick as the first time. And you know, it's tough coming off a series that's just gotten canceled to be hired right back on another series, especially when they had their choice of every actor in town. But then I did the movie Quiz Show, which came out around that time, and I think my stock went up a bit. And as a result, they offered me the role of David, which is one of those examples of how in Hollywood, you're only as good as your last thing. When you're on a series that's been canceled, there's a little bit of a stink on you. When you do well in a movie that's seen as really great, you're revitalized for six weeks.", "(2011, on The Birdcage) That was very fun for me to do. And also terrifying. It was my first big role in a film, and it was kind of an out-there role to be my first big one. It was really a fluke, the way I got that. It was originally written just to be a one-scene part. That first scene where I'm dressing Nathan Lane, getting him all dressed up? The maid/houseman was supposed to be a whole other character, who was supposed to be a black character like it is in the French version, and... I think he was going to be played by David Alan Grier. And they thought David was brilliant, but they thought that in an American context, the idea of a black houseman would be somewhat distasteful and have racist overtones. So since it's set in Miami, they decided to make it a Latin character. And I was already playing the other character. So I think it was Robin Williams' idea: Why not just combine the two roles and just let Azaria do it? Which turned into what you could call my big break, I suppose.", "(2011, on Heat and working with Al Pacino) There's a scene where Al Pacino's interrogating me, and... I shot that on the night of my 30th birthday. And it happened to also be Al's birthday. We have the same birthday: April 25. It just so happened, however, that I was shooting The Birdcage at the same time, and my first day on The Birdcage was the following morning. So I had to go straight from the Heat set, where I shot 'til 6 in the morning, over to the Birdcage set, where I shot the whole rest of the day. That was my 30th birthday. And Mike Nichols found that out and took pity on me. He said, It's your birthday? I said, Yeah. He said, What are you going to do? I said, Well, I've been shooting for 18 hours straight so far. And he's, like, Oh, God, go home. We'll do something else. Which was very sweet. Although I kind of felt robbed, too, because I kind of wanted to say that I shot for 24 hours straight...Pacino was awesome. Michael Mann does like to shoot a lot of takes-if you're going to shoot it once, you're going to shoot it about 25 times-and Al really likes to play around. But I was so young and naive then that I was silly enough to ask Michael Mann if, when Al was improvising, I could sort of improvise back and start riffing. And Michael Mann thought about it for a minute, then said, Nah, just say what's on the page. I mean, now, of course, as a more experienced actor, I would just not ask. It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission, you know? I'd just start riffing right back at Al. But I asked Michael and he said no, so I'd be doing the same exact thing on every take while Al was improvising all these brilliant things. It probably frustrated Al, looking back on it. It was probably annoying to him. But one thing that did make it into the movie that was extemporaneous was... I don't know if you remember, but I say something like, I don't know why I got mixed up with this stupid broad, and he says [Does a loud, spot-on Pacino impression.] 'Cause she's got a great ass! He just screams it. And that was the line, but Al kind of yelled it for the first time, and he did it so completely out of nowhere that it scared me. So much so that I just went, Jesus! Not in character, just as Hank. I got frightened, and I went, Jesus! And then Al improvised [As Pacino.] I'm sorry. Something happens to me when I think about a woman's ass. Or whatever it is that he said. And that actually made it into the movie! Michael Mann told me not to improvise, and the one line that I said that wasn't scripted made it in there because... I don't know, I guess because it was a good moment. Because I was scared of Al.", "(2011, on Huff) It was a very difficult show to make. As rough and hard to look at as the subject matter was, the doing of that show was equally difficult. It was very logistically challenging. There were a lot of disagreements about what the show should be, and Bob Lowry-who wrote the show, who is brilliant-it was tough to marry our visions all the time, and we both cared so much about it that neither of us were willing to let go. So it was one of those difficult situations where... I think it came out great, but that was the grain of sand, if you will, that created the pearl. And it was also because the subject matter was so rough. It was kind of hard to do that all day long. It's a lot more fun to do a comedy all day long. But I got to work with my very close friend Oliver Platt, who was one of the reasons I wanted to be an actor. When I went to Tufts, we did a lot of productions together, and he was equally great back then as he is right now. I found his performances back then inspiring. They inspired me to want to keep going as an actor...Working on that show, I just remember... Especially the first year was the hardest, most emotional job I had, both due to acting the subject matter and agreeing on what we were going to put out there. It was dark.", "Just watching 'Jack Lemmon' (qv) made me want to get into this business.", "Godzilla's a monster for the 90s. He's been working out.", "(2011, on Godzilla) That was... Ultimately, you'd have to call it a tough experience. I remember I was with Helen Hunt at the time-we were together-and that movie was a big break for me as well. It was a big part in a big, big action film. I remember right before I went to shoot, Roland Emmerich met with me and said, So, listen, I've decided all the exteriors are going to be in the rain. I think the creature's going to look much more excellent in the rain, so this is what we're going to do. I'm, like, Okay, man! I get home and tell Helen, and... It's going to be a five-month shoot, and I say, Every exterior's going to be in the rain, and she said, Oh, my God, you're kidding me. That's terrible! And I had not worked enough... I don't think I'd ever shot in movie rain before, and I didn't know what that meant. And I learned very quickly that that was absolutely a disaster. I mean, you get soaked, and... I remember in particular that there was a stretch of three and a half weeks of night shooting in L.A., all in the rain. By 4 a.m., you're just permanently shivering. There's no getting around it. And talking about acting, the only usable takes were the ones that your teeth weren't actively chattering in. It was one of those things where you just kept telling yourself, Look, I'm going to get through this, because it's going to be a huge film! Again, like Mystery Men, it was still early enough in the days of CGI where it wasn't as seamless with what you were doing with these creatures that weren't there. Now it's much more actor-friendly, how you act like that, but back then, they were still sort of figuring it out, and it was hard and not very rewarding. But again, we all kept telling ourselves, Well, it's all going to be worth it when the movie makes a gajillion dollars. I know it was perceived as a tremendous flop, so it was a tough experience. Tough to make, and very disappointing when it came out. It was one you definitely chalk up and say, That was part of paying your dues, better luck next time.", "(2011, on Herman's Head) I was very excited to get that when I got it. It was... fun. It was one of Witt-Thomas' last real big shows. [Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas] had an amazing run of really funny sitcoms in the '70s and '80s-Soap, The Golden Girls, Empty Nest, blah blah blah-and I was really psyched. I learned a lot. You know, there's nothing that replaces when, every week, you have to get out there and make shtick work, basically. I never really stayed with the stand-up thing. I think a lot of comedians find those kinds of chops out on the road and spend years doing stand-up and working audiences. The Simpsons meant a lot for me as far as learning to create characters, but there's no audience when we record The Simpsons, so it's a different thing. So to just get out there and make jokes work week after week after week... That's what I remember most about that show. Especially the times when the jokes were, y'know, maybe not that great, and you really have to make a purse out of a sow's ear, if you will. That becomes a skill that's even more valuable than making good material work, in some ways. For a comedian, anyway. Like they say, there's no unfunny material, only unfunny actors, which isn't quite true. I made really good friends doing that, but the truth is... I didn't really love that show...And the people who still come up to me and say, Oh, Herman's Head, I used to love that show, it's... It's always an awkward moment when people come up to you and they like something you did that you don't like, 'cause you kind of want to go, Well, then, you must be kind of an idiot. But you don't say that, of course. You say, I'm glad you enjoyed it. But I was sort of happy when that show ended. I was kind of tired of doing that.", "(2011, on Tuesdays With Morrie) Working with Jack Lemmon was a tremendous learning experience. I asked him a lot about acting. It was actually very moving when I realized halfway through shooting that... Jack actually was quite ill when he shot that, so I think that's why the material spoke to him so much.", "(2011, on Cool Blue) That was the very first film I ever did. I mean, Pretty Woman was the first film I had any lines in, and Quiz Show was the first kind of big film I did, but Cool Blue... I can't remember which came first, Pretty Woman or Cool Blue. But it was certainly the first big part I had in a film. I learned a lot. I became good friends with Woody Harrelson, and Richard Shepard and Mark Mullin and I got really close, the guys who wrote and directed that. I made a lot of friends doing that, and I was absolutely terrified. I had no idea what I was doing. I remember one night, we hung out with Sean Penn, which to me was like... I mean, I still hold him in the status of, like, Marlon Brando or whoever, but to be 23 years old and grow up pretty much idolizing Sean Penn, and then to get to hang out with him one night? I think I remember that more than anything we did while actually shooting the movie. He was as cool as you would imagine he'd be...I can tell you this story, which I've told a bunch of other places, but I kind of cut my teeth on that movie. As an actor, I look back and see a lot of mistakes and bad acting that I do here and there, but one time I was watching TV late-this was about 15 years ago-and it came on in the middle of the night. My girlfriend's asleep on my shoulder, and I'm watching it, and I'm kind of glad she's asleep, because I kind of wanted to check it out, 'cause I didn't feel like I was very good in it. And I'm watching it, and I'm, like, You know, this isn't as bad as I thought. I mean, I'm doing okay. Sure, I found some moments that, if I could do 'em over again, I would. This is on a regular channel, with commercials and everything, and they even had an announcer. And he said [Announcer voice.] We now return you to Cool Blue, starring Woody Harrelson... and Hand Azaria. Pronounced my name Hand. I couldn't believe it. I woke my girlfriend up, I'm like, Did you hear that? I just got called 'Hand Azaria'! How do you make that mistake? He must be reading it off a card, but what, he's like, Well, this is either 'Hank' or Hand,' and what with 'Hand' being the more common name... [Laughs.] I have no idea how he made that mistake. But some of my friends to this day will refer to me as Hand Azaria.", "(2011, on Mystery Men) That movie... I look at it now very, very fondly. I actually just saw a little bit of it a couple of weeks ago and enjoyed it. It was one of those that was very, very difficult to make and should've been much more fun than it was. It was logistically a very hard movie to shoot, with all the effects, and it was kind of the early days of CGI things, and people didn't know so well how to marry that kind of technical filmmaking with comedy. It was tough. It was really like trying to be funny in the middle of a math equation or something. And as a result, it made things... Very long hours, very stressful and tough on the set. I think we all felt-we being the actors: me and Ben, Bill [Macy], Janeane [Garofalo], and others-very out there, if you will. It was kind of a big swing, or a high-wire act, and it would've been hard enough just to do a little comedy with that subject matter, but given that it was a big, expensive CGI festival, it was highly pressurized. It was tough to all agree, between the producer, the director, and Ben, Bill, and myself, especially, and then all the others actors, too. I mean, when you've got that many comic minds-Janeane, Paul Reubens-not to mention Geoffrey Rush and Lena Olin, it was tough for everybody to agree on the vision. And it was a first-time director, a guy named Kinka Usher, who was a brilliant visual guy and does a lot of commercials, but was not an old salt, and he had to be a daddy on the set to a bunch of ego-y actors running around, wanting their funniest bits in. So it was... There were some hilarious moments where, y'know, there we are, dressed as these ridiculous superhero characters, having very heated arguments about what we should be doing or saying, and we'd take two steps back and go, What are we doing? I have a turban on, I'm throwing a fork, and I'm yelling about what I think would be the funnier way to throw it at somebody. It was just ridiculous. But it was a long, technical, difficult shoot, and I think it could've come out better if we'd all found a way to have more fun with it."], "trivia": ["Based the voice of Comic Book Guy (in _The Simpsons (1989)_ (qv)) on his college roommate.", "Engaged to 'Helen Hunt (I)' (qv) in 1997.", "Based the voice of quack Dr. Nick Rivera (in _The Simpsons (1989)_ (qv)) on actor 'Desi Arnaz' (qv).", "He and his ex-wife 'Helen Hunt (I)' (qv) have both guest-starred on the TV show _Friends (1994)_ (qv), though not in the same episode.

He founded the televised on-line fashion magazine, FashionNewsLive.com, which almost overnight has become ranked as one of the top ten out of the 150 million fashion and celebrity sites around the world. He hit the ground running in 2004 with his very first interview on the red carpet with Anna Nicole Smith. Not bad for a rookie. The fact that she tried to make out with him didn't even scare him away from pursuing his lifelong dream of working in the fashion industry. But making dreams come true takes more than good looks and charm. It takes hard work and determination as well. Even though he makes it look easy, Rocco came from humble, though very loving beginnings. He learned to communicate with his hands through sign language before he could even speak because of his mother, who was born deaf. This naturally gave him a lifelong appreciation for the underdog, along with the advantage of a much more enhanced sixth sense. Being in the right place at the right time doesn't hurt either. It was a Miami model scout with an obvious eye for spotting talent who advised Rocco in 1994 to try his hand at modeling. Miami quickly turned into Milan and Paris, which turned into New York and the rest is history as they say. Within a short time, he was signed with Boss and Zoli. Rocco wanted more, though, and it was when he picked up a camera in Germany that he discovered his own eye for photography. A natural behind the camera, he impressed several major publishers and soon after secured gigs from Maxim Magazine and Ocean Drive. But the model-turned-photographer still wasn't satisfied. In 2000 he moved to Orlando, founded his own production company, RLG Productions, Inc., and set up shop at the back lot at Universal Studios. His vision for a unique televised fashion magazine format was soon picked up by the now defunct UPN and maintained a strong presence on the network until its demise. He quickly transitioned his vision into an online media empire, which continues to grow and thrive today as he provides a steady stream of compelling entertainment and fashion content for millions of fashionistas around the world. The 6'5 former model may dress from head to toe in Marc Jacobs and Gucci, but that is not what makes him fashion's latest It Guy. It's more than likely the combination of his soulfulness, his uncanny ability for discerning the next big thing and his beguiling quintessence that landed him on the pop culture radar and will undoubtedly make him a household name. With his eye on television or radio as a next step, the rising star is certainly not going to slow down anytime soon.

Born and raised in Hollywood, California, Lang graduated from Beverly Hills High School where she concentrated more on becoming a jockey or training for the Olympics than studying to be an actress. She took only a few drama classes in school, but fate guided her into an acting career. It began on the set of _Skatetown, U.S.A. (1979)_ (qv) when the producers took one look at Lang and cast her as the 'Patrick Swayze' (qv)'s girlfriend. She signed with an agent and soon landed roles on such TV shows as _Happy Days (1974)_ (qv), _Magnum, P.I. (1980)_ (qv) and _The Last Precinct (1986)_ (qv). A minor part as Gretchen on _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv) in 1981 led to appearances in films such as _The Night Stalker (1986)_ (qv) and _Desperate Lives (1982) (TV)_ (qv). In addition, Lang is known for appearing in several Beach Boys' music videos which epitomize her as the modern California Girl. In 1986, at age 26 the actress landed the part of Brooke Logan, a blue collar chemistry student destined to become rich, on an in-development soap-opera.

Her on-screen rivalry with 'Susan Flannery' (qv)'s Stephanie Forrester was legendary. As of 2015, Lang is one of only two original cast members still appearing on the show. Lang also appeared on sister-show The Young And The Restless in 1999 and 2007 during cross-over-story-lines. A fan favorite for decades, it wasn't until 2013 when Lang received her first Daytime Emmy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress.

Rose was born Charles Peete Rose, Jr. on January 5, 1942 in Henderson, North Carolina, the only child of Margaret (Frazier) and Charles Peete Rose, Sr., tobacco farmers. The Rose family lived near the railroad tracks in Henderson, in rooms above the general store that his parents owned and managed, and where Charlie helped out. After graduating from high school, where he starred on the basketball team, Rose entered Duke University as a pre-med student. His extra-curricular activities included working with children in a Head Start program. One summer, he secured an internship in the office of North Carolina senator B. Everett Jordan. According to him, his experiences as an intern turned him into a political junkie and, upon returning to college, he changed his major to history. After receiving an A.B. degree in 1964, he entered the Duke University School of Law but, sometime before or shortly after earning a J.D. degree in 1968, he realised that the practice of law held little interest for him. Inspired by the idea of building something as an entrepreneur, he started taking classes at the New York University Graduate School of Business (he had moved to New York City in 1968) and accepted a job at Bankers Trust. Through his wife, who was doing research for the CBS television show _60 Minutes (1968)_ (qv), Rose became friendly with people employed in broadcasting and he developed what soon became a passionate interest in the broadcast media. After his wife was hired by the BBC in the United States, he handled some assignments for the BBC on a freelance basis. In 1972, while continuing to work at Bankers Trust, he landed a job as a weekend reporter for WPIX-TV, in New York City. During his approximately one-year stint at WPIX, Rose tried several times, without success, to contact 'Bill Moyers (I)' (qv) for an interview.  In 1974, Moyers telephoned Rose, after Rose's wife spoke to Moyers about him at a social gathering. At their first meeting, he and Moyers felt an instant chemistry and, within weeks, he began working as the managing editor of the PBS series Bill Moyers' International Report). (Moyers has said that Rose served as his alter ego as well at that time.) In 1975, Moyers named him the executive producer of _Bill Moyers' Journal (1972)_ (qv), a PBS documentary and conversation series although, by his own account, Rose had no great desire to be on camera. In the following year, he became the correspondent for U.S.A.: People and Politics, Moyers's new weekly PBS political magazine series. A Conversation with Jimmy Carter, one installment of that series, won a 1976 Peabody Award. Later in 1976, after Moyers left public television to work for CBS, Rose accepted a Washington, D.C.-based job as a political correspondent for NBC News. In the belief that he lacked sufficient training to do a proper job and that he should get the maximum amount of on-air experience, as he put it, he seized opportunities to host interview shows. He first appeared as a guest host on Panorama, on WTTG-TV, in Washington, D.C. In 1978, after leaving NBC, he served as a co-host with AM/Chicago, on WLS-TV. A year later, Blake Byrne, the general manager of KXAS-TV in Dallas-Fort Worth, hired him as programme manager and, although the station had no budget to pay Rose to do a talk show, he also offered him a time slot for what became _Charlie Rose (1991)_ (qv).  In 1981, with the goal of securing national syndication, Rose moved _Charlie Rose (1991)_ (qv) to Washington, D.C. where, for the next two years or so, it was broadcast on the NBC-owned station WRC-TV. At the same time, he hosted another weekly interview show for WRC-TV. At the end of 1983, CBS hired Rose to anchor _CBS News Nightwatch (1982)_ (qv), an interview program that was taped during the day and was broadcast five times a week between 2:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M. Rose has recalled having a wonderful time during his six-and-a-half years as the CBS News Nightwatch host. Like that of Charlie Rose, the CBS News Nightwatch guest list was not confined to the world's movers and shakers. Among the other people whose activities or histories caught Rose's interest was the convicted murderer 'Charles Manson' (qv), with whom he talked for three hours. The CBS News Nightwatch broadcast of Rose's interview with Manson won an Emmy Award in 1987.  In 1990, Rose left CBS to serve as anchor of Personalities, a syndicated programme produced by Fox Television. Angry to find himself hosting a tabloid-like news show, he broke his contract after just six weeks. About ten months later, he approached PBS-affiliated station Thirteen/WNET-TV in New York City, with a proposal for a new interview show. Charlie Rose premiered on Thirteen/WNET on September 30, 1991. During nine months in 1992, it also on the Learning Channel. Syndicated nationally since January 1993, it airs on 215 PBS affiliate stations. The show's premise is simple; engage the best politicians, thinkers, personalities, celebrities, sports figures, artists, writers and scientists in one-on-one conversation without any gimmicks and irritating commercial breaks. The show's simple black background and round oak table serve to do just that, along with Rose's intelligent interviewing style and ability to ask pertinent questions, forcing the essence of the personalities to come out.  Rose has interviewed the likes of President 'Nelson Mandela' (qv), President 'Bill Clinton (I)' (qv), 'Salman Rushdie' (qv), 'Madonna' (qv), 'Bono (I)' (qv) of 'U2' (qv), 'Bill Gates (I)' (qv), 'Meryl Streep' (qv), 'Warren Beatty (I)' (qv) and countless others. According to a conversation he had with 'Chuck D.' (qv) of 'Public Enemy' (qv) fame, he has conducted over 100,000 interviews. Divorced, Rose splits his time between a rented townhouse in Manhattan (that, according to him, is filled with an embarrassing amount of electronic equipment) and Bellport, Long Island. On weekends, when not enjoying the rich, cultural life of New York City or preparing for his show, he travels to his farm near Oxford, North Carolina or to the upstate New York farm of a friend."], "birthnotes": ["Henderson, North Carolina, USA"], "birthdate": ["5 January 1942"], "height": ["6' 3 1/2"], "spouse": ["'Mary King' (1968 - 1980) (divorced)"], "birthname": ["Jr., Charles Pete Rose"], "article": ["Contra Costa Times (USA), 3 January 2008, by: David Bauder, Oops!

One of the very few (and very first) performers to win an Oscar, an Emmy, a Tony and a Grammy, she was born Rosita Dolores Alverío in Humacao, Puerto Rico, on December 11, 1931, to seamstress Rosa María (Marcano) and farmer Francisco José Paco Alverío. She and her mother moved to New York City in 1937, where she began a professional career before reaching adolescence. The 11-year-old Rosita got her first movie experience dubbing Spanish-language versions of US films. Less than a month before her 14th birthday on November 22, 1945, she made her Broadway debut in the play Skydrift at the Belasco Theatre, costarring with 'Arthur Keegan' (qv) and s young 'Eli Wallach' (qv). Although she would not appear again on Broadway for almost two decades, Rita Moreno, as she was billed in the play, had arrived professionally.  The cover of the March 1, 1954, edition of Life Magazine featured a three-quarters, over-the-left-shoulder profile of the young Puerto Rican actress/entertainer with the provocative title Rita Moreno: An Actresses' Catalog of Sex and Innocence. It was sexpot time, a stereotype that would plague her throughout the decade. If not cast as a Hispanic pepper pot, she could rely on being cast as another exotic, such as her appearance on _Father Knows Best (1954)_ (qv) as an exchange student from India. Because of a dearth of decent material, Moreno had to play roles in movies that she considered degrading. Among the better pictures she appeared in were the classic _Singin' in the Rain (1952)_ (qv) and _The King and I (1956)_ (qv).  Director 'Robert Wise (I)' (qv), who was chosen to co-direct _West Side Story (1961)_ (qv) (the film version of the smash Broadway musical, a retelling of 'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv)'s Romeo & Juliet with the warring Venetian clans the Montagues and Capulets re-envisioned as Irish/Polish and Puerto Rican adolescent street gangs, the Jets and the Sharks), cast Moreno as Anita, the Puerto Rican girlfriend of Sharks' leader Bernardo, whose sister Maria is the piece's Juliet.  However, despite her talent, roles commensurate with that talent were not forthcoming in the 1960s. The following decade would prove kinder, possibly because the beautiful Moreno had aged gracefully and could now be seen by filmmakers, TV producers and casting directors as something other than the spitfire/sexpot that Hispanic women were supposed to conform to. Ironically, it was in two vastly diverging roles--that of a $100 hooker in director 'Mike Nichols (I)' (qv)' brilliant realization of 'Jules Feiffer' (qv)'s acerbic look at male sexuality, _Carnal Knowledge (1971)_ (qv) (1971), and Milly the Helper in the children's TV show _The Electric Company (1971)_ (qv) (1971)--that signaled a career renaissance.  Moreno won a 1972 Grammy Award for her contribution to The Electric Company's soundtrack album, following it up three years later with a Tony Award as Best Featured Actress in a Musical for The Ritz (a role she would reprise in the film version, _The Ritz (1976)_ (qv)). She then won Emmy Awards for _The Muppet Show (1976)_ (qv) and _The Rockford Files (1974)_ (qv).  She has continued to work steadily on screen (both large and small) and on stage, solidifying her reputation as a national treasure, a status that was officially ratified with the award of the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President 'George W.

William Henry Cosby, Jr. was born on July 12, 1937, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Anna Pearl (Hite), a maid, and William Henry Cosby, Sr., a U.S. Navy sailor. After tenth grade, Cosby joined the Navy and completed high school through a correspondence course. He later took up an athletics scholarship at Temple University, supporting himself during his studies by tending bar, where his easy-going style and witty joking with the clientèle prompted suggestions that he try stand-up comedy. This he did and was soon to be discovered by the legendary 'Carl Reiner' (qv).  In his early twenties, he appeared on many well-known variety programs including _Toast of the Town (1948)_ (qv) (aka The Ed Sullivan Show). His big break came in 1965 when he appeared as Alexander Scott in _I Spy (1965)_ (qv), winning numerous Emmys for his performance. He later appeared in _The Bill Cosby Show (1969)_ (qv), playing a teacher, although originally the show only lasted for two years. He then created a Filmation cartoon based on many of his high school buddies including Weird Harold, Dumb Donald, Mushmouth, and others: the show was, of course, _Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids (1972)_ (qv). The theme was humorous but also focused on Cosby's more educational side. He studied for many years during his career in the 1960s and 1970s, and he received a doctorate in Education from the University of Massachusetts. Cosby also starred in some highly successful movies such as _Uptown Saturday Night (1974)_ (qv), _Let's Do It Again (1975)_ (qv), _A Piece of the Action (1977)_ (qv), _Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976)_ (qv), and _California Suite (1978)_ (qv). During his early years he also made some comedy albums that sold very well; his most notable comedy song being Little Old Man. He was one of the original cast members of _The Electric Company (1971)_ (qv), and he was featured in the series _Pinwheel (1977)_ (qv) during the late 1970s and then appeared in the mediocre _The Devil and Max Devlin (1981)_ (qv).  In 1984, 'Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids' stopped production, and _The Cosby Show (1984)_ (qv) commenced. The show was originally intended to follow a blue-collar family, but finally ended up portraying a white-collar family. It was originally rejected by ABC, accepted by a then-floundering NBC, and was an almost instant success. From 1985 to 1987 the show broke viewing records, with Cosby becoming perhaps the strongest driving force in television during the eighties. Despite this great success, he arguably created his own downfall. The Cosby Show led what was considered by many at that time to be the best night of television: the line-up included _Night Court (1984)_ (qv), _Hill Street Blues (1981)_ (qv), and _Family Ties (1982)_ (qv), which all followed The Cosby Show.  Cosby was dissatisfied with the way minorities were portrayed on television. He produced the TV series _A Different World (1987)_ (qv) and insisted that this program should follow the Cosby Show, rather than Family Ties. A Different World was set in an historically Black college and concentrated on young people and education. Impact was felt on the show immediately; at its peak, the Cosby Show logged an estimated 70 million viewers. However, after the scheduling reshuffle, the show lost roughly 20% of its massive audience. However, Cosby was still riding high in the early nineties until massive competition from _The Simpsons (1989)_ (qv).  The Cosby Show finally ended in 1992, conceding to _The Simpsons (1989)_ (qv), with the final production considered to be one of the highest-rated shows of the season and featured a pleading Cosby asking for peace in riot-torn Los Angeles during the height of the 'Rodney King (I)' (qv) riots. Cosby never seemed able to top the success of the Cosby Show; his film _Leonard Part 6 (1987)_ (qv) was considered to be one of the worst American films in history and may have contributed in part to his downfall as a film actor, along with his performance in _Ghost Dad (1990)_ (qv). He did attempt a minor comeback in 1996 starring in the 'Robin Williams (I)' (qv) film _Jack (1996)_ (qv), which was directed by 'Francis Ford Coppola' (qv); and in another show, _Cosby (1996)_ (qv), (starring 'Phylicia Rashad' (qv), who appeared as his wife in the previous Cosby Show). Since then he has produced films such as _Men of Honor (2000)_ (qv), and shows including _Little Bill (1999)_ (qv).  Sadly, his son Ennis was murdered in 1997. Throughout the years, Bill Cosby has taken a socially conscious tone, often associated with family values, coupled with a distinctly urban spin on his style."], "birthnotes": ["Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA"], "birthdate": ["12 July 1937"], "height": ["6' 1"], "spouse": ["'Camille O.

It was in Norfolk, where he lived until he was inducted into the US Navy in 1943, that he started his show business career. At age 14, Carson began appearing as the magician The Great Carsoni at local venues.  In 1962, Carson was chosen by NBC to succeed the controversial 'Jack Paar (I)' (qv) and his _Tonight Starring Jack Paar (1957)_ (qv). Paar had decided to quit the show and begin a once-a-week show for NBC in prime time on Friday nights. Carson would never be controversial like Paar, preferring to good-naturedly skewer politicians and celebrities in his opening monologue and staging stunts such as the on-stage marriage of retro-singer 'Tiny Tim' (qv) to his Miss Vicky in 1969. His popularity with the late-night audience became so great, and the income from advertising on his show so profitable that, in 1967, NBC had to lure Johnny back to _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)_ (qv) after a walkout with a three-year contract guaranteeing him a minimum of $4 million. In the early 1970s, TV Guide reported that Carson was earning $2 million a year, making him the highest paid TV entertainer ever, a record he repeatedly surpassed, pulling down a then-record $5 million annual salary in the 1980s. Carson created a sense of intimacy with his guests and audiences that made him the unvanquished King of Nighttime TV. Countless talk shows hosted by the likes of 'Joey Bishop (I)' (qv) and 'Dick Cavett' (qv) and other non-talk show programs were launched against him year after year only to fail, with the notable exception of _ABC News Nightline (1980)_ (qv) halfway through his reign. Aside from his loyal audience, Carson was beloved by his guests and the legions of young comics whose careers were launched on The Tonight Show, colloquially known as The Johnny Carson Show. His tempestuous love-life, which included two high-profile divorces, became the fodder of such celebrity staples as The National Enquirer and later People Magazine, and he was even the subject of a roman a clef pulp novel in the early 1970s. There have been at least seven published biographies of Carson.  After brief stints on radio stations in Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska, Carson's career was exclusively in television, starting with work at Nebraska TV stations in the late 1940s which preceded his 1951-53 skit program _Carson's Cellar (1953)_ (qv) on Los Angeles station KNXT-TV. Attracting the attention of the industry, he was hired as a comedy writer for _The Red Skelton Show (1951)_ (qv) which provided him with a career breakthrough when Skelton was injured backstage and Carson substituted for him, delivering his first monologue before a national audience. This led to a stint as the host of the quiz show _Earn Your Vacation (1954)_ (qv) and the variety showcase _The Johnny Carson Show (1955)_ (qv) in 1955-56. The man who would soon become the most famous late-night TV personality in history hosted the daytime game show _Do You Trust Your Wife (1956)_ (qv) from 1957-62, teaming up with long-time sidekick 'Ed McMahon (I)' (qv) in 1958.  Before his triumph on _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)_ (qv), Carson tried his hand at dramatic acting, appearing in Three Men on a Horse (episode # 1.29) during the inaugural season of _Playhouse 90 (1956)_ (qv) in 1957. In 1960, he shot a pilot for a prime-time TV series, Johnny Come Lately, that was not picked up by a network. Carson had sat in for Tonight Show host 'Jack Paar (I)' (qv) in 1958 and, when Paar left the show four years later, NBC chose Carson as his replacement, taking over the cat bird seat on Oct. 2, 1962. _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)_ (qv) became a major phenomenon in American pop culture in the 1960s and beyond. Sidekick McMahon's Heeeeere's Johnny!!! introduction of Carson became a cultural catchphrase, memorably re-prised by 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv) in 'Stanley Kubrick' (qv)'s _The Shining (1980)_ (qv), 'Woody Allen' (qv)'s character in the Best Picture Academy Award-winning _Annie Hall (1977)_ (qv), stand-up comic Alvy Singer, is recognized in front of a movie theater by a street tough due to his appearance on The Tonight Show.  Aside from his banter with celebrities, he amused his audience for 30 years with broadly played skit comedy by his Mighty Carson Players and his spoof clairvoyant Carnac the Magnificent. A master at quick repartee, Carson was a relaxed host with a pleasant, ingratiating manner and was quite funny as a skit comedian, but it was the monologue in which Carson's comic genius flourished. He made memorable put-downs of politicians and celebrities, a format still used by his successors 'Jay Leno' (qv) and 'David Letterman' (qv) and legions of comics who came after him.  But it was his ironic self-awareness that made him radically different from such monologists as 'Bob Hope (I)' (qv). When a joke bombed during his monologues, Carson would do a wounded double-take as the audience jeered, fully aware of the awfulness of the joke he had just unloaded. Following these bombs with a sly, self-deprecating remark engendered a sense of intimacy between Carson and his fans. Carson typically moved the blame for a groaner onto his joke writers, which created a We're in this together camaraderie with his audience that spawned a whole new era of self-referential comedy, perhaps best epitomized by Letterman, the man Carson wanted to succeed him on The Tonight Show.  A liberal in the increasingly liberal age of the 1960s and 1970s, so powerful were his opening monologues that by the early 1970s, he could actually affect society at large outside of the pop culture realm. A joke about a shortage of industrial grade toilet paper caused a national panic and a run on all grades of t.p., with a resulting shortage of the product about which he had kidded. Playing off current events such as the Watergate crisis, his comic evisceration of President 'Richard Nixon' (qv) was credited with some critics as exerting such a drag on Nixon's approval rating that it made his resignation possible, if not inevitable. After Carson's reign, it became increasingly de rigueur for politicians to appear on late-night TV talk shows and bear a host's jibes in order to stump for votes. Carson's connection with the American culture was so absolute, it contributed to one of his few failures, the rejection of The Tonight Show in the early 1980s by British audiences who could not understand the topical references of his monologues. And his audience's identification of Johnny with the Tonight Show effectively stopped him from work in other media. In the mid-1960s, Carson's agents wanted to trade on his vast popularity to position him in motion pictures as the New 'Jack Lemmon' (qv), but Carson never made the foray outside of television. His connection with the movie industry remained his hosting of three generations of stars and his memorable turns as the host of five Academy Awards telecasts from 1979 to 1984. In that role, he generally is regarded as the best successor to long-time Oscar host 'Bob Hope (I)' (qv). He did stretch his wings as a producer, his Carson Productions producing TV pilots and series, TV movies and _Late Night with David Letterman (1982)_ (qv) in addition to his own talk show.  The six-time Emmy-winner considered a follow-up to The Tonight Show, but nothing caught his interest and he spent the last decade of his life in a quiet retirement in Malibu, California, as befitted his private nature. Thus, it was The Tonight Show that remains his creative legacy. Unlike every other TV star, he remained on top until the very end, the show winning its ratings period every year for 30 years. When Carson retired, his last appearance was one of the highest rated late night TV shows ever.  I have an ego like anybody else, Carson told The Washington Post in 1993, but I don't need to be stoked by going before the public all the time. 'Frederick De Cordova' (qv), the producer of The Tonight Show throughout Carson's 30-year run, believed that Johnny never pressured himself to launch a follow-up as he already had achieved unprecedented success on TV. He is one of a kind, was one of a kind, De Cordova said in 1995. I don't think there's any reason for him to try something different. Carson, who was suffering from emphysema and had quadruple bypass surgery in 1999, died peacefully at the age of 79 on the morning of Sunday, January 23, 2005, surrounded by his family and friends. In terms of career longevity, popularity, peer respect and impact on the medium, Carson ranks with 'Lucille Ball' (qv) and 'Jackie Gleason (I)' (qv) as one of the greatest stars of television.

McMahon. Born August 24, 1945, to second- generation wrestling promoter Vincent J. McMahon, the young Vince eventually transformed his father's regional wrestling promotion, the northeastern U.S.'s World-Wide Wrestling Federation (later World Wrestling Federation, or WWF), into a worldwide success. Vince, who attended Fishborne Military School as a youth, was a star wrestler in high school. He eventually graduated from East Carolina University with a degree in marketing. By the early 1970s, the younger Vince convinced his father to hire him as promoter for his company, Capitol Wrestling Corp. (which promoted wrestling events as the WWF) He promoted his first WWF wrestling card in 1971 (in Bangor, Maine); the event was a rousing success, and started Vince Jr.'s rise to professional wrestling glory. In 1972, the then 27-year-old McMahon began providing play-by-play commentary for the WWF's weekly syndicated program; at the same time, he helped increase market clearances for the WWF's syndicated programs from nine northeastern U.S. stations (in 1972) to more than triple that by 1980. In 1982, the younger Vince purchased the Capitol Wrestling Corp. from his ailing father (he died in 1984), and began planning a vision to become the world's largest and most successful wrestling enterprise by giving the WWF a much broader audience. McMahon accomplished that through combining the traditional sport of wrestling with elements from the entertainment world (hence the term, sports entertainment); and giving the promotion a national audience (by promoting WWF events and selling airtime to local stations nationwide; airing weekly programs and pay-per-view events on cable and satellite TV). He also initiated one of the first successful major wrestling events, 1985's WrestleMania. However, McMahon's ride to success hasn't always been smooth -- in the early 1990s, allegations of steroid use among top superstars and other misconduct within the WWF nearly ruined Vince and his company. Also, ventures into the realms of bodybuilding (the World Bodybuilding Federation) and professional football (the XFL) failed miserably. For years, McMahon was engaged in a bitter ratings and promotions war with Ted Turner's wrestling ventures (the last being World Championship Wrestling (WCW); it was a battle Turner commanded at one point. McMahon eventually won the battle and today enjoys one of the world's most successful entertainment dynasties. His family -- wife, Linda; son, Shane, and daughter-in-law Marissa; and daugher Stephanie -- all play key roles in the family venture.

That made him unfold for me immediately as a multi-dimensional character. Prior to this I'd been used to playing monsters and, occasionally, heroes and that kind of thing.

At the time it seemed to me, and it turned out to be a real miscalculation, to get the truth about Hollywood, the form had to be larger than life, a musical. I did a lot of strange things on that. Because of my background I went for actors on it and not singers. I'm in love with actors. I had great musical people, the best. I had 'Twyla Tharp' (qv) as my choreographer. 'Prince (I)' (qv) as my songwriter. 'Sinéad O'Connor' (qv) did one song, a beautiful song. And I went to work, and it was the first time I fell in love with my leading lady, who was this six-year-old magical child. And her mother was great--part of the movie was based on my experience with my own two daughters, and I sort of became a surrogate dad. I had all these other people around me that I loved and it was great. And then we went to our first preview. And it was a disaster. We had walkouts, it was awful. Then the worst thing of all happened--someone who saw it told somebody who told somebody who told the Los Angeles Times about what had happened, and then they came after the story. So now here I was trying to fix the film and I actually have the major home-town newspaper publish what had happened, and kill us dead in the water. And they made a story out of my odyssey, came to my next preview and it was just horrendous. So eventually I pared down the music, took almost all of it out. And you can speculate on a lot of things about why the picture didn't work. I'm a guy who started out in one form and changed it to another, but the movie played and people laughed, because I saw it with an audience.

She got her Bachelor in education in 1967 at Emporia State University in Kansas and a Master's degree in speech and theatre in 1969 from Missouri State University as Alden strived to be a teacher. Eventually becoming a multiple award winning writer for daytime dramas on CBS, it all started with Alden's Communication Arts dissertation for her Ph.D. at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Encouraged by her college advisers to write about dead people because their body of work is complete, Kay instead decided to write about her passion, soap operas, hooked on since age twelve. The dissertation title was Daytime Serials as Mediators of Social Change and as part of her research Alden took the bold step to contact - then on-the-rise writer - 'William J. Bell' (qv). Alden was invited to Bell's home on Chicago's Lake Shore Drive and a requested 45 minute interview turned into 2 1/2 hours. Bell took a liking on the student's sharp mind and asked her to turn in sample scripts for his new soap-opera _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv) for which he paid the student 50 Dollars. After months of type-writing at home and sending sample scripts back and forth, Bell officially hired Alden as a script-writer and her career started on May 13, 1974. When The Young and The Restless expanded to an hour length in 1980, Alden switched over to the newly created position of breakdown writer on the show, breaking up Bell's weekly and long-term story projections into daily story-arcs, and served as script editor from 1983-1985 and 1986-1987. As the writing staff expanded once again when William J. Bell launched sister-show _The Bold and the Beautiful (1987)_ (qv) Alden became associate head writer in 1987. Long since considered Bill Bell's protégé and groomed by the now legendary master of daytime drama story-telling, Alden was officially named co-head writer in 1997 before Bell handed Y&R over to her entirely in summer of 1998. Alden's initial reign as head-writer was well-received by fans and critics alike, creating the extremely popular Glow by Jabot-Kids-storyline amongst many others. A staple of her writing were social impact storylines, e.g. about cancer and homelessness. Backstage struggles with long-time producer 'Edward Scott (I)' (qv) had little influence on Alden's work who remained in the position of head-writer (alone or with 'John F. Smith' (qv) and 'Trent Jones (I)' (qv) respectively) until February 2006 when 'Lynn Marie Latham' (qv) took over as Y&R's ratings (as well as all other soap operas and television in general) had suffered drastic declines in viewership for several years. Alden continued to remain onboard as co-head writer but eventually left Y&R after a record 32 years of service in December 2006. Alden was hired by 'Brian Frons' (qv), then-president of ABC Daytime, to consult on its serials 'All My Children (1970)_ and _One Life to Live (1968)_. She left ABC Daytime after declining All My Children's head writer position in Spring 2007 (for undisclosed reasons), and returned to the Bell family fold to work on another CBS Daytime drama. She was hired by Bill Bell's son 'Bradley Bell (I)' (qv) in May 2007 to be an associate head writer for The Bold and the Beautiful. After undergoing financial core status during the writer's strike of 2008 - which caused her to lose her voting rights in the guild - she served as defacto head-writer and, after the strike was over, Alden was appointed co-head writer of B&B. A position which she held until October 2013. In the long course of her career, Alden has won 5 Daytime Emmy Awards (including 2 when she served as head writer) and 2 Writer's Guild Awards. Alden never really moved to the West Coast where her scripts were brought to life, although two of her three children had minor roles as child actors on Y&R. Alden has been married for decades to esteemed Chicagoan business man Vernon Nelson, her high school sweetheart whom she met again 15 years after their graduation.

At the age of 14 he appeared in _Big Wheels and Sailor (1979)_ (qv) for the Children's Film Foundation.  Wright studied English and Drama at the University of Exeter.

He started out wanting to be a ventriloquist. Thankfully for cartoon lovers that career didn't pan out. How do you think his potential career would've stacked up against Edgar Bergen and later, Paul Winchell? No matter, Messick made his way to the hallowed halls of MGM in the early '50s on the recommendation of another voice actor, Daws Butler. At the time, MGM/Tex Avery were doing the theatrical Droopy cartoons. Bill Thompson, known for his hilarious voices on the radio show 'Fibber McGee and Molly', borrowed his Wallace Wimple voice and applied it to Droopy. Whenever Thompson couldn't make it to a session, MGM would ask Daws Butler to fill-in. Daws had been working for MGM since the mid '40s. Later, Daws apparently grew tired of the role and suggested Don Messick be Bill Thompson's fill-in. Butler, it's been said, literally squeezed his cheeks together to try and get that sound for Droopy while Messick simply thickened his tongue and loosened his jaws. Messick made the rounds and did every voice-over role large and small in this era. In 1957 Hanna-Barbera started their own company after departing from MGM...Daws Butler and Don Messick were the two voice actors the animation titans employed during the early days. Don was always heard as the second banana character or a walk-on. At various times he was the villain. His voice was heard as the 'narrator' on all of the early Hanna-Barbera cartoons. On Ruff and Reddy, the duo's first made-for-TV cartoon series, Don was heard as Ruff the cat and as the Droopy-sounding Professor Gizmo. Messick was also the narrator who interracted with the duo and got caught up in the action much like a soap opera announcer on radio. Daws was Reddy, the dog, among other nameless characters in the show. In this 1957-1966 time span, Don Messick was cast as Daws Butler's voice partner and as the cartoon narrator. Boo-Boo was the little friend of Yogi Bear who lived in Jellystone Park. Yogi stole pic-a-nic baskets while Boo-Boo always tried, unsuccessfully, to steer Yogi to a more safer life always reminding him the Ranger isn't going to like it, Yogi. The Ranger in question was Ranger Smith, the park ranger who always chased and stopped Yogi's latest schemes. Messick gave voice to the Ranger. Daws was Yogi. In other programs, Messick was heard as Pixie Mouse to Daws Butler's Dixie Mouse and Mr. Jinx. On Snagglepuss, Messick was always heard as the villain, mostly the befuddled Major Minor. Daws was Snagglepuss. In Huckleberry Hound, Daws was the star character while Messick usually did the narration as well as played a villain. Messick would later provide the voices of Astro and RUDI on the Jetsons. As a versatile voice actor, Messick performed a dozen wacky space aliens on the space cartoons of the mid '60s. The gibberish of Gloop and Gleep on the Herculoids cartoon was Messick. Blip, Igoo, Zorak, Tundra, and Zoc are just a few of the characters that Messick groaned or grunted for in the outer space cartoons...his most famous non-verbal voice is the snickering dog, Muttley...later called Mumbley. Richochet Rabbit, Vapor Man, Falcon 7, Dr. Benton Quest, and Multi-Man are other voices from Messick in that era. In 1969 he provided the voice for his most famous role, Scooby-Doo. Throughout the '70s and beyond, Messick gave voice to this cowardly great dane. In 1980 he became the voice of nephew, Scrappy-Doo, while in later versions Daws Butler was on hand as Scooby-Dum. On the 1977 Laff-a-Lympics cartoon, Messick not only announced the show but he performed some of the characters too. Papa Smurf became Messick's biggest original character in the '80s but he remained busy providing voices for his older characters in new Hanna-Barbera productions. Daws Butler and Mel Blanc were also living off their famed characters by reprising the voices in numerous made-for-TV cartoon movies and Saturday morning TV in the late '70s on into the next decade. Messick remained a much-used voice actor and in 1988 ABC announced A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. Messick was back in the role and voiced the character until it's demise in 1990. His friend and voice partner, Daws Butler, passed away in 1988. In 1989 Mel Blanc passed away leaving Don Messick, June Foray, Stan Freberg, and Paul Winchell as the remaining link to the classic era. In 1989 The Smurfs went out of production. On the new Tiny Toon Adventures, Messick was heard as Hamton Pig, a role he remained with until his mysterious retirement in 1996 at the age of 69 which was later revealed to be a result of a stroke.

Her mother, Emma (Harris), was a teacher and a nurse, and her father, Robert James Johnson, Jr., was a clergyman. Whoopi's recent ancestors were from Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. She worked in a funeral parlor and as a bricklayer while taking small parts on Broadway. She moved to California and worked with improv groups, including Spontaneous Combustion, and developed her skills as a stand-up comedienne. She came to prominence doing an HBO special and a one-woman show as 'Moms Mabley' (qv). She has been known in her prosperous career as a unique and socially conscious talent with articulately liberal views. Among her boyfriends were 'Ted Danson' (qv) and 'Frank Langella' (qv). She was married three times and was once addicted to drugs.  Goldberg first came to prominence with her starring role in _The Color Purple (1985)_ (qv). She received much critical acclaim, and an Oscar nomination for her role and became a major star as a result. Subsequent efforts in the late 1980s were, at best, marginal hits. These movies mostly were off-beat to formulaic comedies like _Burglar (1987)_ (qv), _The Telephone (1988)_ (qv) and _Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986)_ (qv). She made her mark as a household name and a mainstay in Hollywood for her Oscar-winning role in the box office smash _Ghost (1990)_ (qv). Whoopi Goldberg was at her most famous in the early 1990s, making regular appearances on _Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987)_ (qv). She admitted to being a huge fan of the original _Star Trek (1966)_ (qv) series and jumped at the opportunity to star in Star Trek: The Next Generation.  Goldberg received another smash hit role in _Sister Act (1992)_ (qv). Her fish-out-of-water with some flash seemed to resonate with audiences and it was a box office smash. Whoopi starred in some highly publicized and moderately successful comedies of this time, including _Made in America (1993)_ (qv) and _Soapdish (1991)_ (qv). Goldberg followed up to her success with _Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993)_ (qv), which was well-received but did not seem to match up to the first.  As the late 1990s approached, Goldberg seemed to alternate between lead roles in straight comedies such as _Eddie (1996)_ (qv) and _The Associate (1996)_ (qv), and took supporting parts in more independent minded movies, such as _The Deep End of the Ocean (1999)_ (qv) and _How Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998)_ (qv). Goldberg never forgot where she came from, hosting many tributes to other legendary entertainment figures. Her most recent movies include _Rat Race (2001)_ (qv) and the quietly received _Kingdom Come (2001)_ (qv). Goldberg contributes her voice to many cartoons, including _The Pagemaster (1994)_ (qv) and _Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990)_ (qv), as Gaia, the voice of the earth. Alternating between big-budget movies, independent movies, tributes, documentaries, and even television movies (including _Theodore Rex (1995)_ (qv)).  Whoopi Goldberg is accredited as a truly unique and visible talent in Hollywood. Perhaps she will always be remembered as well for Comic Relief, playing an integral part in almost every benefit concert they had. Currently, Whoopi Goldberg is the center square in _Hollywood Squares (1998)_ (qv) and frequently hosts the Academy Awards.

He had one older brother, Bradley, who was killed in World War II. At the age of 16, Clark got his first job in the mailroom of WRUN, a radio station in Utica, New York, which was owned by his uncle and managed by his father. He worked his way up the ranks and was promoted to weatherman before becoming a radio announcer. After graduating from Syracuse University with a degree in business administration, Clark began working at several radio and television stations before landing at WFIL radio in 1952. While working at the station, Clark became a substitute host for Bob Horn's Bandstand, an afternoon program where teenagers danced to popular music, broadcast by WFIL's affiliated television station. In 1956, Horn was arrested for drunk driving, giving Clark the perfect opportunity to step in as the full-time host.  After acquiring nationwide distribution the newly reformatted program, now titled American Bandstand, premiered on ABC on August 5, 1957. In addition to the name change, Clark added interviews with artists (starting with Elvis Presley), lip-sync performances, and Rate-a-Record, allowing teens to judge the songs on the show - and giving birth to the popular phrase, It's got a good beat and you can dance to it. Clark also established a formal dress code, mandating dresses and skirts for the women and a coat and tie for the men. But perhaps the most impactful change that Clark made to the show was ending American Bandstand's all-white policy, allowing African American artists to perform on the show.  Under Clark's influence, Bandstand became one of the most successful and longest-running musical programs, featuring artists including Chuck Berry, the Doors, the Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, and Smokey Robinson. Sonny and Cher, The Jackson 5, Prince, and Aerosmith were among the influential artists and bands that made their television debuts on Bandstand, which is also credited with helping to make America more accepting of rock 'n' roll.  With the success of American Bandstand, Clark became more invested in the music publishing and recording businesses, and began managing artists, hosting live sock hops, and arranging concert tours. But in 1960, when the United States Senate began investigating payola, the practice in which music producing companies paid broadcasting companies to favor their products, Clark became caught up in the scandal. The investigation found he had partial copyrights to over 150 songs, many of which were featured on his show. Clark denied he was involved in any way, but admitted to accepting a fur and jewelry from a record company president. In the end, the Senate could not find any illegal actions by Clark, but ABC asked Clark to either sell his shares in these companies or leave the network so there was no conflict of interest. He chose to sell and continue on as host of American Bandstand, which was unaffected by the scandal.  In 1964, Clark moved Bandstand from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and became more involved in television production. Under his company Dick Clark Productions, he produced such shows as Where the Action Is, TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes, and more recently, So You Think You Can Dance, as well as made-for-television movies including Elvis, The Birth of the Beatles, Wild Streets, and The Savage Seven. Clark also hosted television's $10,000 Pyramid, TV Bloopers and Practical Jokes (with co-host Ed McMahon), Scattergories, and The Other Half. Clark also had several radio programs, including The Dick Clark National Music Survey, Countdown America, and Rock, Roll & Remember.  In 1972, he produced and hosted the very first edition of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, a musical program where Clark counted down until the New Year ball dropped in Times Square, featuring taped performances from musical artists. New Year's Rockin' Eve soon became a cultural tradition, airing on ABC every year with Clark as host (except in 1999 when ABC aired ABC 2000: Today, a news milestone program hosted by Peter Jennings). In December 2004, Clark suffered a minor stroke and was unable to host, so Regis Philbin stepped in as a substitute. The following year, Clark returned as co-host alongside primary host Ryan Seacrest. Many were worried about Clark due to his slurred and breathless speech, and he admitted on-air he was still recovering but that he wouldn't have missed the broadcast for the world. The following year, Seacrest became New Year's Rockin' Eve's primary host, but Clark always returned for the countdown.  Clark has received several notable awards including four Emmy Awards, the Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, and the Peabody Award in 1999.

Then they reset everything to shoot and he was just immeasurably professional that day. Just all over the place, working way above and beyond, busting his ass, knew all his lines, hittin' his marks really sharp, and elevating it. And as much as you could elevate _The Double 0 Kid (1992) (V)_ (qv), elevating it.

That's how I spend my money. A buddy of mine and I took a trip from Africa to Micronesia. It was awesome. Thailand, Palau. I don't buy watches or jewelry, but I'll spend a shitload on a trip to Dubai. Dubai was crazy. I'm weird famous in Dubai because there's so much Western business there and the people are adopting Western culture. Everywhere I went, I got tagged.

It's a show I love to watch, so it's a thrill to get to be on it. It's a fairly easy job to do, and I have a lot of fun. And the fact that fans are responding, too, it blows my mind. I mean, it's exciting that people like it. It makes me feel like there's a similarity in consciousness... No, that's not a good way to explain it. I feel like there's a similar sense of humor. It's nice to feel like I'm not crazy for thinking the show is funny. Know what I mean?", "_Knockaround Guys (2001)_ (qv) is the movie that I essentially left Buffy to do. This was an incredible opportunity that got presented to me. The guys that had written _Rounders (1998)_ (qv) were directing their first feature. 'Lawrence Bender' (qv) was producing it, a relatively unknown 'Vin Diesel' (qv) was starring in it. 'Barry Pepper' (qv) and 'Andy Davoli' (qv), and then 'Tom Noonan (I)' (qv), 'John Malkovich' (qv) and 'Dennis Hopper' (qv). So it was a great opportunity for me to play something that I'd never played before: a darker, more complicated, kind of tragic character. And that movie, it just got tied up in politics. New Line was going to release it, and they had had a string of failures leading up to it and were kind of bottoming out their distribution budget and focusing everything on starting _The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)_ (qv). They were about to put all their money into developing and producing three back-to-back movies, and as a result, a ton of pictures got shelved until they could figure out what to do with them. Some were going directly to DVD, some were gonna get released on cable, some were still being held out for theatrical, and they felt like Knockaround Guys was a theatrical release. So it got held for a while, and unfortunately that wound up looking like . . . It got held long enough that Vin Diesel became a big star and got paid $20 million to do _xXx (2002)_ (qv), and then the marketing people thought, Well, we should just wait until 'xXx' comes out to release this movie, as opposed to trying to put it out beforehand. And what that looked like was an opportunistic release, leading people to believe that the movie was no good and that they were just trying to capitalize on the success of xXx and Vin becoming a bigger star. It was just unfortunate, because I really loved the movie, and I don't think it ever got seen by anyone, and there was kind of a stigma around it that it was shelved for a lack of quality, which just wasn't the case.", "_Without a Paddle (2004)_ (qv) is one of the best experiences I've had making a movie, but also the hardest movie I've ever made, because it was so physical. And cold. And exhausting. And everything in that movie is us in our underwear in some kind of unforgiving environment. But three months isolated in different areas of New Zealand with 'Matthew Lillard' (qv) and 'Dax Shepard' (qv) - I couldn't have been happier. We just had fun every day. It was a really, really great experience.", "_Four Kings (2006)_ (qv) was a tremendous amount of potential, I thought. I was very excited to do that show with the guys who created _Will & Grace (1998)_ (qv). I loved the cast that got put together and it, unfortunately, was at a time when NBC was really unclear as to what kind of shows they wanted to be making. And here was a show about lifelong best friends that was supposed to be how these guys look out for each other, and how your best friends are the people that know you the best and can shit on you the worst. Instead, at least once an episode, one of us said to another, I just don't know if we can be friends any more over some kind of ridiculous conflict. So instead of it being a show celebrating friendship, it became a show about these bizarre conflicts between us that were somehow making us not interested in being friends.", "[on making _Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004)_ (qv)] Really fun. It was one of those movies where you get that offer, and it's like, Is this gonna hurt or help me? Or neither? Is it just something I get to do? And I had a great conversation with a friend of mine. We just determined that it wasn't anything that would hurt me, career-wise. It was a fun opportunity to work with friends of mine, to do a really fun kids' movie that was iconic in pop culture. You know, it was an easy job. It was a blast, too. I got to wear glasses and be a museum curator.", "[on his brief role on _Sesame Street (1969)_ (qv)] I called them up to see if I could get on the show. I was like, Am I famous enough that I can call and ask to be on 'Sesame Street' yet? And I guess I was. So they were like, What do you want to do? And I'm like, Anything, just put me on with some Muppets, please! And I actually flew to do Sesame Street immediately after filming _Without a Paddle (2004)_ (qv). I flew back from New Zealand, I was in Los Angeles for less than four hours, then I flew to New York and got in at midnight for a 7 a.m. call. That's why I look so haggard on it. But it was a really incredible experience. They pulled a bunch of the old Muppets out of storage and let me play with them, so I got to meet Grover and Oscar, and Big Bird and Cookie Monster, and The Count and Bert and Ernie.

I rarely use a cell phone and I don't have a fax. But part of the reason I got this job is that I'm good at making complicated technical terms sound normal. It sounds obnoxious, but I compare it to doing ['William Shakespeare (I)' (qv)]. You just figure out the emotional content of the line and go with that. It doesn't matter what you're saying if you come from an honest place. Though most people don't know half the words, you don't have to dumb down. I hate when they show a policeman saying I've got a 3-U at Baker Street . . . breaking and entering. No one talks like that.", "[of his character Lyle in _The Italian Job (2003)_ (qv)] There's no greater way to gain an audience's sympathy than by being unfortunate. My main goal was to not make him this mono-dimensional computer guy. There had to be a reason this guy could hang with this tough crew. I didn't want him to be dorky, but a little unfortunate and a little embittered, the kind of guy who has this massive motorcycle he can't even ride.", "[on improvising:] . . . three movies with 'Mike Myers (I)' (qv) certainly loosened me up. He told me that there's a switch in your brain that censors you, makes you second-guess. You have to turn it off, shut out the fear of being embarrassed and making a mistake. Being a good improvisational actor is all about being in the scene, getting out of your head. 'Conan O'Brien' (qv) is my favorite interviewer because he pays attention and has no game plan.", "[about being a child star:] My childhood success came and went real fast. Between 12 and 16, I grew--as much as I was going to, anyway--and no longer looked the same. Like most child actors, I found it a difficult adjustment. Still, I've done so many things that I wasn't associated with one thing. I'm an actor, not a celebrity. When recognition became an issue a few years ago, part of me felt undeserving. Desperate to maintain my popularity, I was performing all the time. Then, I caught a glimpse of myself at the MTV Music Awards -- dressed in leather, grasping for jokes--and set about changing my habits. Now that I've stopped trying so hard, I'm more comfortable in my skin.", "[of being famous] It's a period of adjustment. I've gotten a lot better at it.

Urban Legend has it that LIFE Magazine picked up the story that he was on the air as The World's Youngest Disc Jockey. He graduated from high school, then for three years majored in Art at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, before switching to Drama and Journalism at the University of Arizona for another two years, all the while working full time in radio to help put himself through school.  It was then that he was given the chance to move to Boston to become a DJ at WRKO. On his way to Boston, his name was changed to Shadoe in a phone call from Alamogordo, New Mexico. In one year, his huge number one success at WRKO in Boston led him to Los Angeles.  With his resonant voice and command on the airwaves, Stevens became one of the City's most popular radio personalities. He then began his first major television career move as the sidekick/announcer for The Steve Allen Show. Back in radio a short time later, he would become a legendary Program Director, creating and launching World Famous KROQ-FM.  Leaving radio after creating three number one L.A. stations - KRLA, KROQ-FM, and KMET-FM - Shadoe went into advertising. He created the Branding, Advertising and Marketing campaign for a West Coast home electronics company called The Federated Group. The campaign increased sales 500%. In four years, the Federated Group grew from 14 local stores to 78 superstores in 5 states. It was one of the most successful regional advertising campaigns in U.S. history and the first regional ad campaign ever to have received a 2-page spread in Time Magazine. His Awards in advertising include Clio Awards and the Big Apple Award. In radio, he received the Billboard Magazine Personality of the Year Award.  Shadoe's more than 1,100 different television commercials for Federated led first to a 3-picture deal with Dino DeLaurentis Entertainment and the cult movie TRAXX, to the number one TV series Hollywood Squares, then to the Fred Silverman produced one hour CBS series Max Monroe: Loose Cannon, followed by the hit CBS sitcom Dave's World.  Along the way, Shadoe replaced Casey Kasem as the host of American Top 40. This became the biggest radio show in the world with one billion listeners a week in 110 countries. During this time, Shadoe was a guest star on more than a dozen television series including Beverly Hills 90210, Baywatch, The Larry Sanders Show, Caroline in the City, Clueless, Fast Track, and Burke's Law.  In motion pictures, Shadoe played the title role in Traxx, Fred in Mr. Saturday Night, Maxwell in Bucket of Blood, and Djony Dakota in Shadoevision for HBO.  Shadoe was the Founder, Chairman, and President of RhythmRadio - The Sound of the World in a Good Mood, that was the first world-wide music network and delivered programming on the radio in 30 countries and programming on the Internet delivered in 7 languages.  Shadoe created Cabo Wabo Radio for rock star Sammy Hagar, designing an all up-all the time rock music format with studios in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico and Bel Air, California. It became the number one Alternative Music format online in the world.  Shadoe then created Mental Radio, - mentalradio.net - a talk/entertainment radio show described as Coast to Coast as if done by Monty Python. It's a show about the extraordinary and inexplicable, interviews with mystics, physicists, dreams, aliens, and those who laugh in the face of fear.  Shadoe was the voice of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson from 2005 to 2015, and has continued to be the voice of countless commercials and television shows including The Grammys, The Emmys, and Comic Relief.  In 2013, Shadoe created and produced the hilarious podcast series, Blackout Television, Improv-Comedy-Theater with an All-Black Cast. It's The Larry Sanders Show meets Curb Your Enthusiasm and is currently in development for the TV One Network as a one hour, prime time television series.  Shadoe has been enthusiastically married since 1986 to his third wife, Beverly. His daughter, Amber Stevens, is a successful actress, having starred in the ABC Family series Greek for four years, and the movie 22 Jump Street in 2014. Shadoe's daughter Chynarose is an artist and works in the beauty industry in a Beverly Hills Salon while going to school. His son Brad, from his first marriage, lives with his family in Seattle and works at Boeing.

Norman Milton Lear was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to Enie/Jeanette (Sokolovsky) and Hyman Herman Lear, a traveling salesman. His grandparents were all Russian Jewish immigrants. Jeanette was the inspiration for the character Edith Bunker, and Herman was the all-time inspiration to Norman creating the character Archie Bunker. Lear has often described his father as a bigot and someone who was into get rich quick schemes. Norman was a victim of the depression and saw his family, as he has described it, go belly-up. Norman was inspired by his press agent uncle Jack, who visited the family and always flipped Norman a quarter. Norman wanted to be the person who could flip someone a quarter.  Lear at this time never really thought of becoming a big Hollywood writer. He won a one year-scholarship to Emerson College in a national high-school writing contest, and went off there with all tuition paid by the government for one year. Norman figured he had struck a gold-mine, and during the depression this was the only way he could get into college. Norman attended Emerson College but dropped out when news struck that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. At that point, Norman has stated, all chaos broke lose, and along with many others he decided to enroll in the United States Army. He was nineteen. In the army, Norman was a radio operator. He was discharged in 1945.  Norman eventually landed a press agent job, paying forty dollars a week. Due to hard times, he was not being paid well and decided to pursue another career. In 1954, he was a writer for the CBS sitcom, Honestly, Celeste! This series was canceled after eight episodes. Lear then became the producer of NBC's The Martha Raye Show, after director Nat Hiken left the series. In 1959, Lear created his first television series, The Deputy, on the NBC network and starring Henry Fonda. Lear created this series alongside Roland Kibbee. The show ran for two successful seasons and ended in 1961.  Lear then started his comedic writing career in 1967. He wrote and produced the 1967 film, Divorce American Style, and directed the film, Cold Turkey, starring Dick Van Dyke. All In The Family came about when Norman read a British column on a show called Til Death Do Us Part, about a father and a son-in-law who fought constantly about everything politically. As soon as he read that, he immediately knew it was just like him and his father's relationship. Lear tried to sell a blue collar sitcom to the ABC network, and two pilots were filmed and rejected. A third pilot was filmed, and CBS picked up the show. It premiered on January 12,1971 to disappointing ratings. Each pilot being shot by different entertainers than the original. Only Caroll O' Connor and Jean Stapleton remained as the original cast, as different people played the brother-in-law and daughter. Lear put Sally Struthers and Rob Reiner in the sitcom only after being accepted by CBS.  When it was aired on television for the first time, a big warning appeared on the screen stating none of the content being presented should be taken seriously and should only be seen for the purpose of hilarity. Norman stated that the sitcom became successful later on, because people knew Archie Bunker: to many people Archie Bunker was their own father. What came next for Norman was the successful sitcom Sanford And Son, along with creator Bud Yorkin, in 1972. This sitcom was inspired by British sitcom Steptoe and Son. Redd Foxx and Demond Wilson played the main roles. In All In The Family, a guest-star named Bea Arthur appeared in an episode and the first spin-off was formed from All In The Family called Maude in 1972, starring Arthur. Ratings soared through the roof, and much more quickly than All In The Family. A memorable episode from Maude which struck a degree of controversy was the abortion episode. A spin-off came from Maude called Good Times with the maid character played by Esther Rolle (Florida Evans). Good Times premiered in 1974, and dealt with controversial issues such as poverty, crime, and welfare, but most of all depicted life in a low-income housing area for African-Americans. It was created by Eric Monte and Mike Evans. This series featured entertainers John Amos, Ester Rolle, Bern Nadette Stanis, Jimmie Walker, Ralph Carter, Ja'net Dubois, and many others. It wasn't the only sitcom to depict life for African-Americans: what later followed in 1975 was The Jeffersons, another spin-off from All In The Family. Many people hadn't realized that African Americans could actually move away from the ghetto and become successful like George and Louise did. To many people across America it was seen as hilarious comedic genius; no other show ever called someone a honky or slammed doors in people's faces and still showed controversial issues to a large degree. In several episodes the show dealt with drugs, violence, and racism. The characters George and Louise Jefferson were created by Eric Monte.  All In The Family received multiple Emmy awards. Good Times ran for five successful season and ended in 1979, with multiple Golden Globe nominations. Maude ran for six seasons, ending in 1978 and receiving multiple Emmy and Golden Globe wins and nominations. Sanford and Son ended in 1977 with a Golden Globe win and several Emmy nominations. All In The Family ended its long run in 1979, with nine successful seasons. What came next for Norman was a spin-off of the show called Archie Bunker's Place, with Caroll O'Connor and Danielle Brisebois. The show was especially memorable as Edith Bunker was killed off, due to Jean Stapleton wanting to leave the show to pursue her acting career further. Norman stated that killing off Edith Bunker was one of the toughest decisions he had to make throughout his entertainment career. Archie Bunker's Place ended in 1983, and was his last successful television show.  Norman attempted to make a comeback in 1990 with several short-lived shows, including Sunday Dinner and 704 Hauser, which featured former co-star of Good Times, John Amos."], "birthnotes": ["New Haven, Connecticut, USA"], "birthdate": ["27 July 1922"], "spouse": ["'Frances Lear' (qv) (7 December 1956 - 1986) (divorced); 2 children", "'Lyn Davis' (5 September 1987 - present); 3 children", "'Charlotte Rosen' (? - ?)

The vehicle that achieved it was _Sam and Friends (1955)_ (qv), a late-night puppet show that was on after the 11:00 news in Washington DC. It proved to be very popular and inspired Jim to continue using puppets for his work. He made many commercials, developing the signature humor that Henson Productions is known for. A key reason for the success of his puppets is that Jim realized he didn't need to hide puppeteers behind a structure when they were in front of a camera. All he had to do was instruct the camera operators to focus on the puppets and keep the puppeteers out of the frame. This allowed the puppets to dominate the image and make them more lifelike. This work on puppets and television would lead to separate projects that had different goals. The first one was his work on the _The Jimmy Dean Show (1963)_ (qv) with the character Rowlf the Dog, the oldest clearly identified character that Henson Productions still uses. This show provided an income that allowed Jim to work on a pet project. That project was _Time Piece (1965)_ (qv), a surrealistic short about time which was nominated for best live-action short Oscar. Henson shot to prominence when he was approached to use his muppets for the revolutionary educational show _Sesame Street (1969)_ (qv). The show was a smash hit and his characters have become staples on public television. Unforetunately, this also led to Henson being typecast as only an entertainer for children. He sought to disprove that by being part of the initial crew of _Saturday Night Live (1975)_ (qv), but his style and that of the creative staff simply didn't jibe. It was this circumstance that encouraged him to develop a variety show format that had the kind of sophisticated humor that _Sesame Street (1969)_ (qv) didn't work with. No American broadcaster was interested, but British producer 'Lew Grade' (qv) was. This led to _The Muppet Show (1976)_ (qv). It initially struggled both in the ratings and in the search for guest stars, but in the second season it became a smash hit and would eventually become the most widely watched series in television history. Hungry for a new challenge, Henson made _The Muppet Movie (1979)_ (qv), defying the popular industry opinion that his characters would never work in a movie. The film became a hit and spawned a series of features which included the moody fantasy _The Dark Crystal (1982)_ (qv), which was a drastic and bold departure from the amiable tone of his previous work. The most successful TV work in the 1980s was _Fraggle Rock (1983)_ (qv), a fantasy series specifically designed to appeal to as many cultural groups as possible. During this time he also established the Creature Shop, a puppet studio that became renowned for being as brilliant with puppetry as ILM was at special effects. When he died all too soon in 1990, he was indisputably one of the geniuses of puppetry. More importantly, he was a man who achieved his phenomenal success while still retaining his social conscience and artistic integrity as his work in promoting environmentalism and his brilliant _The Storyteller (1987)_ (qv) series respectively attest to."], "birthnotes": ["Greenville, Mississippi, USA"], "birthdate": ["24 September 1936"], "height": ["6' 1"], "deathdate": ["16 May 1990"], "spouse": ["'Jane Henson' (qv) (28 May 1959 - 16 May 1990) (his death); 5 children"], "otherworks": ["Created many short commercials for Wilkins Coffee, and recreated them for many local products throughout the USA.", "1960: Wrote & illustrated a children's book featuring Kermit the Frog called Watermelons I Don't Know.

As a teenager, he immigrated to the United States and worked in Texas and Montana as a translator, a cowhand, and a lumber millhand. His athleticism won him a scholarship to Montana State University. While attending college, he and friend Bob McKinnon made a film, The Riverbusters, about their successful attempt to be the first men to take a boat from the source to the mouth of the Salmon river and back again. He traveled to Los Angeles in hopes of finding a distributor for the documentary, but instead found that his handsome visage and accented English made him a valuable commodity as an actor. He appeared in small parts under his real name before landing the leading role of the antagonist, Captain Hans Dietrich, on the World War II television series _The Rat Patrol (1966)_ (qv).  The series was a hit, and Gudegast's sympathetic German officer was very popular. He appeared in a few movies and television films thereafter in supporting roles, then was given the lead in Universal's science-fiction computer thriller _Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970)_ (qv). His delight at this huge career boost was muted by the studio's insistence that he change his name. With extreme reluctance, he agreed and became known subsequently as Eric Braeden. Braeden worked continuously in television movies for the next decade. He also worked on Broadway and in Los Angeles area theatre. In 1980, he reluctantly accepted a role in a daytime drama, _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv), and gained a stardom in this medium that had just eluded him in film and prime time television. As lead Victor Newman, Braeden brought a gravity and a strong center to the program. Amazingly handsome and athletic into his sixties, Braeden maintained the charisma that first brought him notice in The Rat Patrol.  His infrequent film work during his nearly quarter century on The Young and the Restless included a prominent role as John Jacob Astor in _Titanic (1997)_ (qv). A five-time Emmy nominee for his The Young and the Restless role (he won in 1998), he was also nominated eleven times for the Soap Opera Digest Outstanding Leading Actor Award, winning three times. In 1987, he was appointed, along with Henry Kissinger, Paul Volker, Steffi Graf, Alexander Haig, and Katherine Graham, to the German-American Advisory Board, and in 1991 received the Federal Medal of Honor from the president of his native land, Germany.

My mother, never a fan of my father's family, had an unfortunate habit of using Levine as a stinging insult. When displeased with me, she would often say/shriek, You know what you are? You're a Levine! A no good, rotten Levine! So, for as far back as I can remember, every time I heard my last name I would experience acute feelings of low self-esteem. ..... My first wife was the one who suggested I change my name to remedy the situation. In fact, it was she who came up with the name Lorre, complete with the fancy spelling. I thought it sounded great. Chuck Lorre. Finally a name that did not make me squirm. It didn't occur to me that in England my new name translated into Chuck Truck. But most interestingly, I had completely forgotten that when I was around eight years old my father's business began to fail, forcing my mother to find work in a clothing store called... Lorie's. Pretty creepy, huh? Did I abandon my father's name only to unconsciously name myself after a place associated with my mother's abandonment of me? Or, even creepier, did my ex-wife somehow know all this and propose the name Lorre just to screw with me? Hmmm...

A native of Long Island, Lorre got his start as a guitarist/singer, touring the country and writing several hundred pop songs that, as he puts it, helped keep him out of the big time (Debbie Harry's top 40 hit French Kissin' in the USA being the lone exception). After more than a decade on the road, Lorre decided to turn his attention to television. He began writing animation scripts for DIC and Marvel Productions, as well as writing and producing the themes and scores for such animated series as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  A spec primetime script soon led to freelance work on the syndicated comedy Charles In Charge and eventually to a staff job on the NBC sitcom My Two Dads, starring Paul Reiser. Lorre's big break came in 1991, when he became a supervising producer on the ABC/Carsey-Werner hit comedy Roseanne. Over the next two seasons, during which he was upped to co-executive producer, Lorre helped bring the show to the height of its critical and popular acclaim, shattering one sacred cow after another in the process.  Since then, Lorre has dominated network television by single-handedly keeping the multi-camera sitcom alive in creating hit series that generate mass appeal. He continues to break television records with Two and a Half Men as it is the number one off-network sitcom in syndication for the 2007-2008 season among Households, which consistently ranks number one on a weekly basis* and is the fastest-growing A-tier sitcom in syndication history since the introduction of barter ratings in the 1988-89 season. During this season, the rebroadcast of the show has delivered more viewers than first-run episodes of nearly every other sitcom. He is also responsible for creating an online buzz when he established the unprecedented idea to illustrate his thoughts by airing messages for a split second on his vanity card at the end of his shows.  In January 2009, Lorre kicked off the New Year when he was honored with the NATPE Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award for exhibiting extraordinary passion, leadership, independence and vision in the process of creating television programming and in evoking the spirit of Brandon Tartikoff's generosity. In February, Lorre was presented with the 2009 Television Showman of the Year Award at the 46th Annual ICG Publicists Awards Ceremony, which recognizes individuals whose creative accomplishments reflect the finest qualities of what has traditionally been defined as showmanship. In March 2009, Lorre was awarded with his Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his life-long contribution of both public and peer appreciation that has forever added to the entertainment industry. Lorre will also be presented with the David Angell Humanitarian Award on behalf of the American Screenwriters Association for demonstrating his charitable efforts at the Venice Family Clinic.

Selig was one of the true pioneers of the motion picture industry. Though not widely remembered today, his Selig Polyscope Co. was responsible for many landmark events in early cinema. Among these were construction of the first permanent studio in Los Angeles in 1908-1909, production of the first cliff-hanger serial (_The Adventures of Kathlyn (1913)_ (qv)) and the first film version of _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1910)_ (qv).  After working as an upholsterer, then a vaudeville magician in Chicago, Selig traveled to northern California in 1890 to run a fruit ranch in a small town called Chicago Park. The move was partially necessitated by health problems he was having at the time. By 1893 William had recovered enough to start an African-American minstrel company known as Selig and Johnson's Colored Minstrels. Performing in the San Francisco area, the most notable member of this troupe was 'Bert Williams (I)' (qv), who would become the greatest African-American comedian of the vaudeville era.  Upon seeing an Edison Kinetescope at the Dallas Fair in 1894, Selig decided to return home to Chicago where he began working on his own camera-projection system. In 1896 he founded one of the world's first motion picture studios. From very modest beginnings, his Selig Polyscope Co. quickly grew to be one of the major players during the pioneer era. With the help of a machinist named Andrew Schustek, Selig designed one of the earliest camera-projectors. Based largely on the Lumiere Cinematographe, his invention would share its name with his fledgling studio.  The first decade of Selig Polyscope's operation was marked by legal turmoil, due largely to the efforts of 'Thomas A. Edison' (qv)'s lawyers. Finally, in 1909, Selig and several other studio heads formed an uneasy alliance with Edison. The resulting Motion Picture Patents Company and its distribution arm General Films would dominate the film industry until 1915. That year the independent companies won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled the M.P.P.C. an illegal monopoly.  Colonel Selig's ambitions were not strictly confined to cinema. Around 1911 he began acquiring land for what would become the largest private zoo in the world. The Selig Zoo at Eastlake (now Lincoln) Park, in Los Angeles was a logical extension of his movie business. Over the years, William had accumulated a sizable collection of animals for his jungle movies. The 32-acre zoo allowed him to showcase his menagerie while leaving room for studios at the back of the grounds. Many famous animals resided at the zoo, including the original Leo the MGM lion.  Once the zoo/studio was in operation, Selig no longer needed the first L.A. studio that director 'Francis Boggs' (qv) had opened for him in Edendale (now Echo Park). An up-and-coming producer named 'William Fox (I)' (qv) decided to lease that site for his soon-to-be-famous company. Another giant of the industry benefited from Selig's initial investment in Los Angeles. 'Louis B. Mayer' (qv) moved into the studios at the zoo once Selig retired from major production around 1920. The Colonel had no desire to compete against these younger, more aggressive movie moguls.  There were other factors which led William to leave the industry he helped found. With the release of _The Spoilers (1914)_ (qv) in 1914, Selig enjoyed his greatest success. At this point Selig Polyscope appeared to have a bright future, but things quickly changed. During this time the industry was evolving from producing the short films Selig specialized in to the modern feature-length productions. While William did make longer films like The Spoilers, he felt shorts were the way of the future. The onset of World War I also hurt Selig Polyscope, given its extensive European operations. Finally, the dissolution of the Patents Company made the industry more competitive, dooming the pioneer studios.  Selig moved into independent production after closing his studios, working infrequently until the 1930s. The Colonel's glory days were past, though, and he faded into obscurity. The cost of operating a large zoo and the Great Depression had reduced Selig's fortune to nothing. He became a literary agent in his later years, selling off the story rights purchased years before for his films. In 1947 Selig and several other film pioneers were awarded special Oscars. He died the following year on July 15, with his loving wife of many years, Mary, at his side."], "birthnotes": ["Chicago, Illinois, USA"], "birthdate": ["14 March 1864"], "deathdate": ["15 July 1948"], "spouse": ["'Mary Holdeness Pinkham' (7 September 1899 - 15 July 1948) (his death)"], "otherworks": ["Magician, minstrel show producer and zoo impresario."], "article": ["Moving Picture World (USA), 12 May 1917, pg. 948-49, ill, Twenty-One Years in the Business", "Moving Picture World (USA), 5 May 1917, pg. 799, William N.

Tom grew up in Houston, in a large family of four sisters, one of whom was openly gay. The shy, soft-spoken and extremely intelligent Byron fast-tracked through high school and graduated one year early. When he turned 18 he moved to Los Angeles, and got a job in an adult video/novelty store, which was located across the street from 'Jim South' (qv)'s World Modeling Agency. South is a well-known booking agent for adult video actors and actresses. One day in May of 1982 Tom decided to walk in and meet Jim. South was cautious at first, because Tom looked younger than what his driver's license claimed, but wound up signing him to a shoot. 'Bobby Hollander' (qv)'s Anything Goes: Gourmet Video 19 (1982) was Tom's first shoot. His first scene was with 'Craig Roberts (I)' (qv) and 'Lili Marlene' (qv), and Tom unfortunately didn't fare too well under the pressure. However, he decided to stick it out and soon landed major roles in _Private Teacher (1985)_ (qv), _All American Girls II: In Heat (1983)_ (qv) and the 'Marilyn Chambers (I)' (qv) vehicle _Up 'n' Coming (1983)_ (qv). With his extraordinary work in those three films, Byron was thrust into the spotlight. Many adult video producers took notice of the talented 21-year-old. Byron, who had been doing a number of loops and magazine still shoots to pay his rent, and work started pouring in.  Tom made a name for himself as the consummate professional opposite such adult superstars as 'Ginger Lynn' (qv) and 'Traci Lords' (qv), with whom he once shared an apartment. Along with his two friends, 'Peter North (I)' (qv) and 'Marc Wallice' (qv), Byron took the adult video world by storm. Between 1982 and 1990 he worked in nearly 1,000 films with virtually every actress in the business. Some of his finest work included the Brat series, where he played the bumbling husband Morty Dickinson, as well as his work in _Sizzle (1982)_ (qv) and _New Wave Hookers (1985)_ (qv). Tom has received countless awards for his scene with Ginger Lynn and 'Steve Powers (I)' (qv) in New Wave Hookers, a scene which Byron has referred to as easy but is regarded in adult circles as legendary. By 1991 he had established himself as a presence in the adult-video world. Unfortunately, that was also the same year that the IRS came looking for him regarding unfiled income taxes. He found himself in serious financial debt and was even looking at some jail time if he couldn't straighten out his problems. In order to pay off his debts, Byron took on a rigorous work schedule. In 1991 he appeared in over 250 videos (averaging between two and three scenes per movie) in addition to appearing in a number of still magazine shoots for European and American publications.  However, by 1992 he was burned out and unhappy with the industry, and began looking for other diversions. He chose music. He formed a band and began touring the L.A. music scene while doing porn on the side. He got some publicity by demanding a condoms-only policy during his scenes, the first actor to do so, but the publicity was short-lived, as was his music career. In 1993 he dedicated himself full time to appearing in adult films, and gave up his condoms-only stance. Between 1993 and 1996 he worked in well over 500 adult videos, often for his old friend, director 'Alex de Renzy' (qv) (aka Rex Borsky). In 1997 Byron signed with a fledgling company called Elegant Angel. Company head 'Patrick Collins (II)' (qv) (aka Roscoe Bowltree) decided to bring Byron on board as an actor and a director (Byron had directed one of the Brat movies when director 'Paul Thomas (I)' (qv) had taken ill). However, Patrick saw the potential in Byron and pushed him to direct his own video series. After shooting a scene with 'Sean Michaels (I)' (qv) and 'Nikki Brantz' (qv) that appeared in _Sodomania 17: S.M.U.T. (1996) (V)_ (qv), Byron was on his way, and was assigned to direct a series called Cumback Pussy. His directing style was very similar to that of his old buddy DeRenzy, and Byron, as well as Elegant Angel, cleaned up at the the Adult Video News Awards.  In 1998 Byron, 'Robert Black (II)' (qv) and 'Van Damage' (qv) decided to leave the stable of Elegant Angel after they felt betrayed by Collins. They formed their own company called Extreme Associates, named for its promise to produce extreme videos. 'Tiffany Mynx' (qv) also left Elegant Angel and became the company's first contract starlet. Byron attempted to convince his good friend Marc Wallice to leave Elegant Angel also. As well as being a longtime friend, Wallice had been one of the people who helped Byron through his transition from performer to director and had also worked as the editor and cinematographer on many of Byron's early Elegant Angel movies. However, by late 1997 it was revealed that Wallice had contracted the HIV virus, and he subsequently retired.  In 1999 Byron began shooting the Lord of Asses, Whack Attack and Planet of the Gapes series, which were very similar to his Cumback Pussy line. He is still going strong and has ventured out, with his friend Rob Black, into the wrestling world. He helped form the Los Angeles-based XPW (Xtreme Pro Wrestling) organization, which is considered the top wrestling outfit behind WWF, WCW and ECW. In 2000 Byron worked almost exclusively for Extreme, with an occasional appearance in a 'Seymore Butts' (qv) video. To date Byron has appeared in nearly 2,000 adult videos, a few mainstream films (such as _52 Pick-Up (1986)_ (qv)) and has been inducted into the XRCO and AVN Hall of Fame."], "birthnotes": ["Houston, Texas, USA"], "birthdate": ["4 April 1961"], "height": ["6'"], "birthname": ["Taliaferro Jr., Thomas Bryan"], "nicknames": ["Tommy"], "interviews": ["Adult Cinema Review (USA), January 2002, Vol. 20, Iss. 1, pg. 49+53+55, by: Ana Leeza and Roger Pipe, Tom Byron: Anal Way You Like It--The King of Porn Gets Probed!"], "pictorial": ["Playboy (USA), November 1985, Vol. 32, Iss. 11, pg. 131, by: Arthur Knight, Sex in Cinema - 1985", "Adult Cinema Review (USA), January 2002, Vol. 20, Iss. 1, pg. 48-55, by: Extreme Associates, Tom Byron: Anal Way You Like It..."] } }

I'm proudest of the fact that I fell in step with an audience taste level that I knew how to judge and maybe deliver for, and consistently, he said in a 2009 oral history interview by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. It wasn't a one-shot. It wasn't a lucky this or a that. There's a consistent body of work here that has some symmetry to it in terms of why it worked and how it worked. Larson's formula was derived, in part, from studying both dramatic programs and comedies. He felt humor worked best when it was closely embedded in a protagonist's unexpected situation. I call it predicament humor, Larson said. You don't do anything that cuts the star off at the knees or worse. You make him intelligent, you give him great ideas and great things to do. But sometimes, things happen. Except for some 1990s shows that received disappointing receptions - including One West Waikiki, which made its debut in 1994 - he felt vindicated by his career.

Unable to resist such amorously appealing odds, four talented and highly motivated teenagers in the school choir, Lead Singer Bruce Belland, baritone Glen Larson, bass Ed Cobb and high tenor Marvin Ingram, literally formed a quartet overnight and stepped into the crinoline void as The Four Preps. After stealing the show with choice hits by their idols, The Crew Cuts and The Four Lads, they quickly found themselves in demand for every kind of event imaginable. We didn't turn anything down, Bruce Belland remembers. We once performed on the back of a flatbed truck for the opening of a parking lot. They paid us $75.00; enough to buy gas and our first matching sport coats. We were totally stoked. A short time later, legendary Capitol Records Producer Voyle Gilmore, who recorded stars like Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra and Louie Prima & Keely Smith, heard a tape of a live performance by The Four Preps and signed them to a long term recording contract. At the time the Preps were the youngest act ever to sign with a major record label. (In an article about their signing, Variety dubbed them Capitol's jolly juveniles.) While The Preps started searching for a hit, their old HHS classmate, Ricky Nelson, was launching a recording career of his own. As his records began to burn up the airwaves, he and The Four Preps embarked on their first nationwide personal appearance tour which kicked off the very week that Nelson's picture was on the cover of LIFE magazine with the caption - RICKY NELSON - Teen Idol - a phrase the Editors had created expressly for him. The group picked up by Capitol Records and scored a hit in 1957 with 26 Miles (Santa Catalina), co-written by Larson. But Larson wanted to be a television writer, and he turned out scripts he hoped to sell while The Four Preps toured extensively. Glen Larson's first story credit came in 1966 for an episode of The Fugitive. He rose quickly in the television business, becoming an associate producer on It Takes a Thief in 1968."], "minibiography": ["Born on January 3, 1937 in Los Angeles, California, Glen A.

Always humorous with the firmly tongue-in-cheek, his series are textbook examples of the genre for any would-be prime-time producer: simple storylines, likable, charismatic lead characters combined with very little violence, no bad language and well-crafted motif-laced soundtracks.

When he was 12 years old, his sisters took him to auditions for a local play, and it was there that he was bitten by the acting bug. A year later, the family moved to Fairfax, VA, where Matthew attended Hayfield High and continued to involve himself in local theatre as well as school productions. After graduation, Matthew attended the highly accredited North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem. During the summer months, he and a friend worked as street performers in Myrtle Beach, SC doing mime, magic, juggling, improv. Eventually, he joined the Ragamuffin Magic & Mime Company where he earned his first professional paycheck.

She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Art History from Northwestern University and did post graduate work in 19th Century Art. She began her career as a fashion designer for a major Los Angeles based garment manufacturer. In 1988, legendary writer 'William J. Bell' (qv) hired Maria Arena for his then-new soap opera _The Bold and the Beautiful (1987)_ (qv) when a spot on his writing got vacant. There, she helped create the character of Sally Spectra who was loosely based on her step-father who worked in the Los Angeles garment industry and also provided design sketches as well as general fashion advice. Not only did her career as a writer get a boost, her private life also changed tremendously when Maria Arena married 'William J. Bell Jr.' (qv) who serves for the production company of his parent's daytime dramas in 1993 after 5 years of court-ship. The couple shares two children. After leaving The Bold and the Beautiful Maria Arena Bell tried her luck in developing television formats for CBS and NBC in addition to her services for various philanthropic organizations in the Los Angeles area. She also worked as an essayist for publications such as T the New York Times Style Magazine, C Magazine, Aspen Magazine, and Aspen Peak Magazine. In a surprising twist, Bell returned to daytime television in December 2007: when 'Lynn Marie Latham' (qv) was fired from _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv) the stay-at-home-mom stepped in alongside novelist and soap writer 'Josh Griffith (I)' (qv). The duo guided the show through the writer's strike of 2008 (causing Bell to lose all privileges within the Writer's Guild of America). Pretty soon, Bell was named sole head writer and became one of the show's executive producers alongside legendary soap producer 'Paul Rauch (I)' (qv). Whilst her initial tenure was considered a creative resurgence putting fan favorites like 'Jeanne Cooper (I)' (qv) back to the fore front and led to the return of several cast and crew members, the latter half of Bell's tenure also caught great controversy amongst critics and viewers as well as slightly sinking ratings. Her dismissal just around the show's milestone 10,000th episode in 2012 nevertheless came as a surprise. In 2011, she was awarded a Daytime Emmy Award alongside her writing team, in addition to a total of 6 nominations as writer and producer on the show. After her departure from The Young and the Restless, Bell founded the production company Vitameatavegamin Productions.

{ "person-name": "Bauer, Wolf", "info": {"minibiography": ["Born in Stuttgart in 1950, Wolf Bauer studied Journalism and History of Art at the universities of Munich and Berlin. He initially began working from 1976 as a political features writer for the ZDF programme Kennzeichen D.  In 1980, Wolf Bauer came to UFA Film- und Fernsehproduktion as an editor and producer and has served as executive producer and CEO for UFA Film & TV Produktion since 1991. Since the founding of FremantleMedia in 2000, he has also sat on the board of this globally active production company. FremantleMedia is the international production arm of the RTL Group which also includes UFA. Under his leadership, UFA has developed into a highly efficient production group with eight subsidiaries which have continuously expanded their leading market position as creator of content in Germany in recent years. The Group has been able to increase its turnover by more than 30 times between 1991 and the present day. As head of UFA, Wolf Bauer founded Grundy UFA in 1991 with Reg Grundy, the Australian game show and daily drama pioneer. Together with Mike Murphy, the two turned it into Europe's largest producer of daily dramas GrundyUFA. With Gute Zeiten - Schlechte Zeiten, he introduced the daily drama to Germany in 1992, and followed this in 2004 with the telenovela Bianca - Path to Happiness. In 1998, he joined forces with Prof. Nico Hofmann and Ariane Krampe to set up teamWorx, today Germany's leading producer of quality TV movies and fiction programmes with event character. The UFA Group's portfolio expanded in 2000 to include entertainment formats after a merger of the UFA's parent holding with Pearson TV and the subsequent founding of the RTL Group. To cover the production of this genre, GRUNDY Light Entertainemt was found. In 2002, Wolf Bauer further expanded the Group by acquiring a majority interest in Phoenix Film. In early 2008, he founded UFA Cinema with Thomas Peter Friedl, Prof. Nico Hofmann and Dr. Jürgen Schuster and serves as CEO and producer. Given the fundamental changes in the media landscape brought about by digitalization, Wolf Bauer has transformed the UFA from a straightforward television producer into a content creator which offers creative solutions for a multimedia exploitation of content. This is not only for all of the major channels in Germany but also for the broadest range of new partners. His goal is to establish a 21st century entertainment company whose focus is on self-created intellectual property to be exploited via all possible channels. The founding of UFA brand communication, the group's 8th label, and of UFA Lab, a content developing laboratory for new media platforms, are due to this transformation process.  Since 2001 Wolf Bauer has been a member of the Advisory Board East for the Deutsche Bank. Together with other producers of the lobby group film20, he successfully pushed for the creation of a central representation for German producers. As a result of these endeavors, the German Producers Alliance (Allianz Deutscher Produzenten) was founded in March 2008, with Bauer a member of the joint board until April 2012. He has also been a member of the Bertelsmann Foundation's board of trustees since 2008."] } }

When he was a junior in high school, he took Public Speaking. That was his first step. He claimed that he made a gag routine out of every speech that he gave (and in the process, antagonized his Public Speaking teacher).", "The story of where Butler's Cap'n Crunch voice came from is more interesting than simply that he was imitating late actor 'Charles Butterworth (I)' (qv). Daws originally used that voice as a king in countless Fractured Fairy Tale cartoons (from the _Rocky and His Friends (1959)_ (qv)). After 'Jay Ward (I)' (qv) told Butler that he felt that this would be a good voice for Cap'n Crunch, never again did he use that voice for cartoons outside of these commercials.", "Following his five-year run on puppet show _Time for Beany (1949)_ (qv), Daws did struggle for a while. Many producers and directors refused to believe that he could still do cartoon voices. They told him, We're not doing anything with puppets anymore! So Daws sent out letters to 100-200 Hollywood producers, telling them that he had talent to do voices and he could also write comic material. The remarkable thing was that he did not use a mimeograph or photocopier (the latter technology being unavailable at the time). Daws actually wrote out each and every one of those 100+ letters individually.", "His very first cartoon character was a kind of smug British character, as he termed it. He recorded that voice sometime in the 1940s. This came about after he tried to break into cartoon voices at Warner Brothers. Everyone asked, Why do you bother? 'Mel Blanc' (qv) does everything. Warners did not use him initially, although it later would use him (without on-screen credit) in several of its cartoons in the late 1950s -- most notably as the voices of Ralph Krumden and Ned Morton in The Honeymousers. Warner also referred him to Johnny Burton and 'Tex Avery (I)' (qv), who helped him get that very first voice credit.", "After he finished his service in the Navy (in World War II) and decided to take his family to Hollywood (rather than New York), they made the trek from Illinios with bad brakes all the way.", "Sons Paul (in music), David (advertising), Don (mailman in Beverley Hills) and Charles/Chaz (doing odd jobs). Their mother Myrtis is 90."], "minibiography": ["Daws Butler spent the greater part of his career as one of the premier voice-over actors in Hollywood- providing the voices for such well- known characters as Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Quick-Draw McGraw, Snagglepuss, Jinks the cat, Dixie the mouse, Augie Doggie, Peter Potamus, Wally Gator, Hokey Wolf, Super Snooper, Blabber Mouse, Cogswell Cogs, Elroy Jetson and many others. He also provided the voices for such long-running commercial characters as Snap, diminutive companion of Crackle and Pop of noisy cereal fame, as well as Cap'n Crunch, spokesman for a somewhat quieter breakfast treat.  Butler was born in Toledo, Ohio and spent his formative years in Oak Park, Illinois. Although his initial ambition was to be a cartoonist, he had a talent for vocal humor and mimicry as well. Paradoxically, he was also quite shy. As a sort of self- imposed therapy, he forced himself to address large audiences by entering local amateur contests and performing impersonations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Rudy Vallee and a Model T Ford starting on a cold morning (an audience favorite). He found that the laughter and applause he got in response was well worth the effort and it clinched his decision to pursue an acting and performing career. Eschewing the last few months of his senior year in high school, he began appearing in Chicago theaters and nightclubs along with two other impersonators he had met along the way. Because they all maxed out at around five feet, two inches in height and primarily did impressions of radio personalities, they billed themselves as The Three Short Waves.  After two years in the Navy during World War II, during which he met and married Myrtis Martin of Albemarle, N.C. (whose next-door neighbor provided the inspiration for what would later become the southern drawl of Huckleberry Hound), Butler ferried his wife and son out to Hollywood. He finally broke into radio, performing in dramatic as well as comedy programs and specializing in dialects and a wide range of vocal characterizations.  In 1949, Butler and Stan Freberg were featured in a new television puppet show called Time for Beany. Butler was the voice of a propeller-capped kid named Beany while Freberg voiced his best pal, Cecil the Seasick Sea Serpent. During five years of five shows a week, they were honored with two Emmy awards.  At Capitol Records in the early 1950s, Butler and Freberg co-wrote and co-voiced a comedy record takeoff on the TV show Dragnet, called St. George and the Dragonet. Not only was Jack Webb flattered and amused by the record, but it was the first comedy record to sell more than a million copies. Butler's and Freberg's partnership produced several other comedy platters beloved by disc jockeys across the country, even today. Butler was also a part of Freberg's comedy ensemble on the Stan Freberg Radio Show in the summer of 1957 and on a later and very popular comedy single called Christmas Dragnet.  After lengthy and very productive collaborations with famed animators/directors Tex Avery and Walter Lantz, Butler embarked on yet another inspired partnership, with William Hanna and Joseph Barbera at Hanna-Barbera Productions. There, beginning in the late 50s, Butler created his most famous cartoon characterizations, aided and abetted by another gifted voice actor, Don Messick-Boo Boo and Ranger Smith to Butler's Yogi Bear and Pixie the Mouse to his Dixie, among others.  For legendary cartoon producer Jay Ward, Butler, along with fellow actors and friends June Foray and Bill Scott, performed in two animated series, Fractured Fairy Tales and Aesop and Son. His long-running Cap'n Crunch character was also a Jay Ward creation.  In his later years, Butler established a popular and respected actors' workshop in his home, training talented students not only in voice- over techniques, but in all areas of acting, including the physical. On that subject, especially, one had only to witness Butler's histrionic physicality when voicing Yogi Bear or his laid- back, sleepy-eyed mien as he became Huckleberry Hound to understand why he considered facial expression and physical movement as essential as sound in producing a living, breathing character. One of Butler's star workshop students was Nancy Cartwright, later the voice of Bart Simpson on The Simpsons. Daws Butler passed away on May 19, 1988 of a heart attack, having just completed three Yogi Bear films and 15 new half-hour Yogi Bear cartoon shows. He also lived to see the rebirth of The Jetsons for a new generation, voicing 30 of the new shows along with all the members of the original cast. During his longest- standing creative collaboration, the 30-odd years with Hanna-Barbara Productions, Daws Butler performed in the neighborhood of 40 different characters.

His professional leadership and relationship building style is based on the establishment of collaborative cultures, encouraging loyalty and dedication through service, unity, and altruism. Benedetti is a specialist in complete production and post production workflows. He has extensive experience maximizing efficiency, and reducing costs utilizing new emerging technologies, work flows, and organizational management styles based on his nearly three decades in administration and business development in all phases of production including network, studio operations, and facilities management. Combining both his practical knowledge and common sense approach with his infectious spirit, Benedetti has advanced in his career through a fearless dependence and faith in the ability to find and nurture the desire to succeed in all those around him.  Benedetti is employed by Westwind Media in Burbank, CA as the Senior Vice President and General Manager. Benedetti's role is as both the facility's administrator as well as marketing and client service specialist. The facility provides complete post production service packages for feature films and television clientele. Most recently he worked at Sony Pictures Entertainment as a member of the executive management for the studio's Post Production Facilities. Benedetti is extremely active supporting the community of the entertainment industry actively serving on various boards and committees of many voluntary organizations. He is an honorary affiliate member of the American Cinema Editors, a past member of the ProducerâEUR(TM)s Guild of America, the Motion Picture Sound Editors (MPSE), and sits on the Board of the Sales Resource Committee of the Hollywood Post Alliance. He received a bachelor's degree in Fine Art and Design from the esteemed California Institute of the Arts in 1992.  Benedetti broke into the entertainment industry working as Ted Danson's personal assistant on the hit TV show Cheers. When Danson started his own production company at Paramount Studios (Anasazi Productions), Benedetti was hired as an assistant to the development team, headed by his father, the Emmy-winning producer, Robert Benedetti. Eventually, Ben began working as a production assistant and then as a post production supervisor on the award-winning films and specials produced by Anasazi through 1995.  In late 1995, Benedetti was hired as Associate Producer of CBS's hit drama, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, and remained there until the show left the airwaves. Benedetti was responsible for the creative and technical integrity of every episode produced. He gained invaluable experience directing all ADR/Looping sessions, working directly with the lead and supporting actors in the cast; supervising every mix, final lay back, and the delivery of every episode to the network.  After Dr. Quinn, Benedetti worked as a consultant at the Disney Channel for Gary Marsh, Susette Hsiung, and Diane Gutterud in the Original Programming department. He was responsible for the development and implementation of a strategic plan for a new department able to administer and manage the post production of dozens of independently produced tele-films simultaneously. To this day the department thrives using the work flows and production bible that Ben helped design and co-author.  In 1999, Benedetti assumed the role of Vice President of Sales and Client Services for Digital Symphony at Ascent Media, one of the leading suppliers of production equipment specializing in non-linear computer editing systems, camera package rentals, remote HD digital dailies viewing systems, and Digital Cinema Preview/Screening services. Eventually his responsibilities were expanded to represent the complete spectrum of post production services that Ascent Media offered including Sound Editorial, Re-recording Audio Mixing, and Telecine, Video Finishing, Visual Effects, and Digital Intermediates.  In 2008 Benedetti moved to Modern VideoFilm in Burbank as Vice President, Sales and Business Development supplying post production services to Hi-Definition Television and Feature Films including Digital Cinema packaging, Digital Intermediates, 4:4:4 Telecine and Color Correction, Non-Linear and Linear HD Assembly, 2D and 3D Finishing, Advanced Data Compression and Distribution.  At the beginning of 2010, Benedetti took on working for Sony Pictures Entertainment in their Post Production Facilities providing complete post production packages and work flows for both feature and television clientele. He directly administrated the award winning TV Sound Editorial department as well working as a sales representative for Sony's Digital Picture Editorial, Post Media Center, Colorworks, and Sony Pictures Sound Facility.  In 2014 he moved to become the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Westwind Media. Westwind Media has been successfully providing high-quality post production services to the entertainment industry for over twenty five years. Founded by artists and producers, Westwind Media has consistently provided the type of low-stress, high technology environment in which creative decisions are most easily made.

Koslow was educated at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University, graduating with a degree in theatre and costume design. Koslow signed on with a summer stock theater group in Virginia as a costume designer. She was also asked to audition for the role of Vera in the play Ten Little Indians. Koslow soon put her costume designing talent aside to become a full-time actress, appearing in such regional productions as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Dial M for Murder. She then moved to Los Angeles to pursue a television career and landed various guest roles before scoring the role of the scheming Lindsay Wells on the hit CBS soap opera _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv) which she played from 1984-1986. She was then asked by the serial's creators 'William J. Bell' (qv) and wife 'Lee Phillip Bell' (qv) to become an original cast member on the duo's new sister soap _The Bold and the Beautiful (1987)_ (qv) which debuted in the spring of 1987. She portrayed Eric Forrester's (played by 'John McCook (I)' (qv)) design assistant Margo Lynley from the serial's inception until 1992 when she left to begin a family. Through the early 1990s Koslow busied herself with guest starring roles in several prime time television series including _Silk Stalkings (1991)_ (qv) and _The Nanny (1993)_ (qv). However, she was lured back to daytime television in 1996 in order to replace actress 'Deborah Adair (I)' (qv) who left the NBC soap _Days of Our Lives (1965)_ (qv) to, ironically, spend more time with her family. In the role of vindictive call girl turned corporate executive Kate Roberts, Koslow flourished on Days of Our Lives quickly becoming a woman fans 'love to hate'. The character is known for her wickedness and deception, specifically her ongoing war with fellow Salem resident Sami Brady ('Alison Sweeney' (qv)) and her rocky marriage with mogul Victor Kiriakis ('John Aniston' (qv)). In contrast to her reel life, in real life Koslow has been married to make-up artist 'Nicky Schillace' (qv) since 1987.

This arrangement worked to the detriment of both producers while it lined the pockets of the French firm, which was able to play the comedy short giants off each other for years. By the time Pathe's U.S. fortunes declined considerably in 1925, Sennett was in far worse shape than Roach, who had valuable reissue rights to 'Harold Lloyd (I)' (qv)'s library, and the wildly popular Our Gang series gained him a lucrative distribution deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (Lloyd, his former associate, jumped to Paramount). Sennett had far less to fall back on. Although he had a well-deserved reputation for discovering talent, being able to keep them under contract was another matter. His inability to hang on to major stars became the stuff of legend. Equally problematic, his comedy style was seriously outdated by the mid-1920s and his most promising recent star, 'Harry Langdon (I)' (qv), quickly departed in an ego-driven rage. Sennett's studio would be sold off in a 1933 bankruptcy and morph into 'Herbert J. Yates' (qv)' Republic Pictures (also see 'Nat Levine (I)' (qv), 'W. Ray Johnston' (qv) and 'Trem Carr' (qv)).

When he was 17, his parents moved the family to East Berlin, Connecticut, and he became a laborer at American Iron Works, a job he continued when they moved to Northampton, Massachusetts. He happened to meet 'Marie Dressler' (qv) in 1902, and through her went to New York City to attempt for a career on the stage. He managed some burlesque and chorus-boy parts. In 1908, he began acting in Biograph films. His work there lasted until 1911; it included being directed by 'D.W. Griffith (I)' (qv) and acting with 'Mary Pickford' (qv) and 'Mabel Normand' (qv). By 1910, he was directing.  In 1912, he and two bookies-turned-producers--'Adam Kessel (I)' (qv) and 'Charles Bauman (I)' (qv)--formed the Keystone Film Company. Sennett brought 'Mabel Normand' (qv) with him and soon added 'Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle' (qv), 'Chester Conklin' (qv) 'Al St. John' (qv), 'Slim Summerville' (qv), 'Minta Durfee' (qv) and 'Charles Chaplin' (qv) (who was directed by Sennett in 35 comedies during 1914). He told Chaplin, We have no scenario--we get an idea, then follow the natural sequence of events until it leads up to a chase, which is the essence of our comedy. To the slapstick chase gags of the 'Keystone Kops' (qv) were gradually added the Bathing Beauties and the Kid Komedies. In 1915 he, Griffith and 'Thomas H. Ince' (qv) formed Triangle Films.  Comedy moved from improvisational slapstick to scripted situations. Stars like 'Bobby Vernon' (qv) and 'Gloria Swanson (I)' (qv) joined him. In 1917, he formed Mack Sennett Comedies, distributing through Paramount--and later Pathe--and launching another star, 'Harry Langdon (I)' (qv). When Sennett returned to Paramount in 1932, he produced shorts featuring 'W.C. Fields' (qv) and musical ones with 'Bing Crosby' (qv). After directing his only 'Buster Keaton (I)' (qv) film, _The Timid Young Man (1935)_ (qv), he returned to Canada a pauper. In 1937, he was awarded a special Oscar--to the master of fun, discoverer of stars... for his lasting contribution to the comedy technique of the screen.  Mack Sennett died at age 80 on November 5, 1960 in Woodland Hills, California, and was interred at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

From her modest upbringing in Puerto Rico; to being discovered on the streets of her hometown; becoming Miss Universe at the tender age of 18 and, soon-after, a movie star in the Philippines and Puerto Rico; marrying and divorcing; raising two beautiful princes; and bravely striving to rebuild her career . . . while Dayanara's story is what dreams, or novelas, are made of it is very much her reality, one that she manages with her signature grace, dignity, beauty and style.  Dayanara Torres Delgado was born in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico on October 28th, 1974 into a poor, very loving and close-knit family. As a child, expression and creativity were important aspects of her playtime. She would enjoy acting out roles such as being a model or a queen. Dancing, swimming and horseback riding were other favorite pastimes, which she continues to cultivate today.  From a very early age, Dayanara garnered honors and merits for good conduct in school. She concluded her 12th grade studies in El Colegio Santa Rosa in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, intending to one day attend college and become an orthodontist. But life would take her in a different and exciting direction.  At the age of 17, during her senior year in high school, she was walking through the Plaza de Toa Alta when she was approached to take part in the Miss Puerto Rico pageant as a representative of her town.  Dayanara still recalls being incredibly surprised as she never saw herself as a beauty queen . . . not for her home town of Toa Alta and even less as a representative of Puerto Rico in the Miss Universe pageant competing with 78 women from all over the world. It was all too wonderful to dare dream it would come true. Yet it did come true, and in Mexico City on May 21st, 1993, Dayanara became the youngest woman ever to be chosen to be Miss Universe.  On the island of Puerto Rico, she became a national treasure, and a parade was held in her honor. Since her reign she has graced the covers of myriads of international magazines (Cosmopolitan, Vanidades, Caras, Imagen, Asian Bride, and Marie Claire, among many others) and has endorsed many products taking part in TV and print advertisements (Diet Coke, Pantene, Vidal Sassoon, RayBan, Banco Popular, Advil, her own doll and line of shoes, among others).  Her humanitarian work during her reign focused on disadvantaged and poverty-stricken children throughout the world. She became an international ambassador for UNICEF, traveling throughout Latin America and Asia in support of the organization's projects, during and after her reign. In 1995 she endowed the Dayanara Torres Foundation which provided aid and scholarships to destitute families in Puerto Rico and the Philippines. In most recent years she has served on the board of, and made contributions to, the Children's Hope Foundation, for children and mothers affected by AIDS and Fundación Sonrisa which helps children with facial deformities in Puerto Rico.  Once her year as Miss Universe was completed, Dayanara traveled to Manila to pass on the crown to the next pageant queen. She even sang a duet during the pageant with Peabo Bryson, called A Whole New World. Little did she know that night that her own life would, once again, take an exciting turn and that she would be living in a whole new world herself.  During her visit to the Philippines, Dayanara became so well-loved that she was offered the opportunity to host two television shows and star in movies. She made the decision to stay, and her short stay was extended to 4 years. In those four years she became a major movie star and the It girl in the country.  She starred in 13 movies in the Philippines and Puerto Rico, among them: Linda Sara (1994) co-starring with singer/actor Chayanne and directed by Oscar nominee Jacobo Morales; Basta't Kasama Kita/As Long As We're Together (1995); Hataw Na/Dance Now (1996); and Type Kita Walang Kokontra/You Belong To Me (1998).  She was the host of the highly rated live variety show ASAP which is broadcast throughout all of Asia. And, as host of another show, Eazy Dancing, became known as The Dancing Queen of the Philippines. The country's Press Club honored her with the Best New TV Personality Award in 1995.  She returned to Puerto Rico in 1998, during the promotion of her album Antifaz, which reached the top of the Billboard Dance charts throughout Latin America and the Philippines. In the Island, she also starred in the theater productions of Cinderella (as Cinderella in 1998) and Peter Pan (as Tinkerbell in 1999).  In honor of her beauty and talent, the Dayanara doll was launched in 1998, complete with a crown, and outfits of a singer, dancer, and model. The doll was immediately sold out in Puerto Rico and the Philippines.  On May 10, 2000, Dayanara wed Salsa/Pop Star Marc Anthony, and made the decision to dedicate herself to her new role as wife and mother. The couple has two children together, Cristian Anthony (born February 5, 2001) and Ryan Anthony (born August 16, 2003).  As this is a fairy tale with modern-day twists. . . Dayanara and her husband divorced in 2004, and the heroine of our story is now in the process of rebuilding her career as an actress, spokesperson and model while caring for her two little princes with the help of her family.  Suddenly, a whirlwind of projects are in the works in the areas of acting, modeling, endorsements, commercials, production, and even product development. . .

{ "person-name": "X, Jonathan", "info": {"minibiography": ["Born in Harrisburg PA. By the time he reached 17, Jonathan was a seasoned global traveler via the military brat lifestyle. Educated at Wichita State University, Jonathan studied, while trying to earn a scholarship playing football, participating in the ROTC program and working as a Resident Assistant all of which strongly reinforced his ability to work in a collective, collaborative environment. On the recommendation of a favorite professor, Jonathan also began his professional media career with KSN the NBC affiliate as a camera operator while still an undergrad. After earning his BA in Communications from Wichita State, Jonathan continued his education at Southern Illinois University in the Film Department (35mm Film with a focus on abstract and avant-garde photography), paying the bills by touring the Midwest college circuit playing drums for various bands. During one tour stop in Chicago, he landed a job interview with Westinghouse Corporation, which led to his employment with the start up of Satellite News Channel then the only competitor to CNN's 24-hour news coverage. After relocating to Washington D.C for SNC, he was hired for the position of technical director for the start up operation of Home Team Sports one of the predecessors of the Regional Sports Networks. After completion of that assignment he went on to become one of the primary Technical Directors at the NBC O&O WRC-4 in Washington D.C. During this period in his career the nickname Jonathan X was developed. After participating in various video art projects Jonathan was offered multiple exhibits (video installations) at local clubs and art houses, leading to two major exhibits at the Chicago Museum of Art. Slow Fade to Black a collection of socio-political art from a variety of artist and Video Congress 235 in Munich, West Germany. When these submissions were entered, he chose to use his middle name, Jonathan and added the letter X as homage to Richard Pryor's early film role in the cult classic Wild in The Streets. Once his co-workers heard of this, it appeared on one of the weekly credit rolls and has stuck ever since. After the NABET strike of 1987, Jonathan relocated to the Los Angeles area to begin anew; this was the hardest period of his professional life, starting from scratch with very few contacts. While waiting and searching for employment he created a half hour video mixed art, philosophy and music video experience project called Art Maggot Hysteria, over 50 episodes created. Hysteria is still spoken of as groundbreaking within the avant-garde arts community. During that time of self-expression, opportunity arrived and Jonathan began his freelance career.

He's authored the inspiring book Great Failures Of The Extremely Successful (Tallfellow Press, Fall 2002) where he was able to get the greats of many different fields to share their remarkable stories of adversity. Of Great Failures..., Jack Canfield, co-creator of Chicken Soup For The Soul said, When you finish reading this amazing book, you will never let failure or fear of failure stand in your way again. Steve has more than shown his grasp of creating stories and characters that both entertain and enlighten (without it being jammed down our children's throats) in his children's picture book series, What If There Were No...? (Smallfellow, 2003) and his first novel, The 130 Tales of Winchell Mink (Harper Collins, 2003). This former stand-up comedian's social and political satire has been recognized as some of the funniest, yet still poignant, with his stories regularly gracing the Oped pages of major newspapers across the country and his tongue-in-cheek punditing seen on CNN and Fox News. As contributing editor at the Writer Guild Of America's Written By magazine, Steve's reputation has given him serious entrance to the best writers and producers in the industry while also allowing him one more outlet to lampoon the entertainment business he so cares about.

Born in Manchester Fred Bernard 'Jack' Barton had an interest in showbusiness from an early age. At 15 he joined Bertram Mills' Circus and at 17 moved to London where he studied tap dancing. Later he toured with stars such as Jessie Matthews and Sonnie Hale in musical comedies.  During WW2 he served in the RAF and on being demobbed he moved to Scotland where he worked as a producer in variety shows.  In 1955 he joined the newley formed ATV in Birmingham as a producer on shows such as Lunch Box, hosted by Noele Gordon. Crossroads, a new soap that featured everyday events at a Midland hotel, was launched by ATV in 1964 and Barton became one of the regular directors of the show. Under his auspices celebrities queued up to appear in Crossroads: Max Wall, Ken Dodd and Larry Grayson were just a few who were guest stars.  One of the show's biggest storylines, directed by Barton, featured the 1975 wedding of Meg Richardson (Noele Gordon) to Hugh Mortimer (John Bentley) which brought the city of Birmingham to a standstill.  The programmes heavy workload was cut to four episodes a week in 1967, and then, on the instructions of the IBA, which was concerned about the shows quality, to three episodes a week in 1980. In 1984 Barton finally left the series and was replaced by the Australian Phillip Bowman. When the plug was finally pulled on the show in 1988, after 4,500 programmes there was a public outcry but Central Television refused to reconsider.

David developed early comedy and character bits with his friends, wrote music, and created light shows. He then benefited from a creative atmosphere at Lake Central High School in St. John, Indiana, which not only had a public TV station, but also continues to have top state programs in music and theatre. He also had lead roles as a teen in semi-professional theatre performances, and regularly did improvisation as a teenager at theatre parties and events.

After spending his childhood in both Washington and Oregon, he caught the acting bug doing high-school musicals. Without any prior professional acting work on his resume, Young scored big at the tender age of 18 when he landed the part of Eric Forrester Jr, called Rick, on the daytime drama _The Bold and the Beautiful (1987)_ (qv). Following his debut on December 31, 1997 the newcomer quickly gained frontburner-status and formed a highly popular love couple with 'Adrienne Frantz' (qv)'s Amber Moore. Despite earning a Daytime Emmy nomination in 1999 and getting the chance to incorporate his singing ambitions on the show, Young opted to leave amidst a red-hot storyline to pursue other opportunities in the Fall of 1999. In 2000, Young landed the coveted recast role of Lucky, son of Luke and Laura Spencer on _General Hospital (1963)_ (qv), for which he won the 2002 Daytime Emmy as Outstanding Younger Actor. He left this show in February 2003 looking to spread his wings. Surprisingly, Young returned to daytime television a mere 6-months-later once again taking over the highly coveted part of the son of a core patriarch: now stepping in as JR Chandler on _All My Children (1970)_ (qv). This role caused the actor to move to New York City - and as part of the deal Young got to make his Broadway debut, playing Lumiére from May to August 2006 in Disney's Beauty and the Beast. He had previously released an eponymous CD, Jacob Young, in 2001. For his work on All My Children Young received two further Daytime Emmy Nominations, including one as Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2009. He stayed with the show - also playing the same role on sister-show _One Life to Live (1968)_ (qv) on several occasions during a highly-rated baby switch-storyline - until its cancellation in 2011. Proving his track record as being one of the most-sought actors of his generation amongst soap opera executives, Young was instantly snatched up by The Bold And The Beautiful.

While Winfrey has been cited as the richest African American of the 20th century, she does not come from a rich, or even middle class, family. She was born in an economically troubled neighborhood and raised by a single-teenaged mother in the city of Milwaukee. Orpah, named after a biblical character, had a name no one could pronounce, so her family and friends starting calling her Oprah. Shortly after Oprah's birth, Vernita Lee left her daughter and traveled north. Oprah was then raised by her grandmother,Hatti Mae Lee. Oprah while being raised by her grandmother lived in terrible conditions. Oprah's only friends were farm animals,however even at that age Oprah had a very imaginative mind. Oprah would frequently give the animals dramatic parts and included them in games. This was perhaps where she had gotten the craze for acting, and would soon be seen in legendary masterpieces such as _The Color Purple (1985)_ (qv). Oprah because of her grandmother's values, had religion and God instilled in herself at a very young age. Oprah because of her grandmother knew how to read,and write before the age of three. Oprah during church would recite poems,and verses from the bible. Soon the church, and the entire neighborhood knew she had a gift and was nicknamed,The Little Speaker. This would soon prompt her to become a woman with a strong perspective, which millions across the world would want to have insight on. This prepared her for _The Oprah Winfrey Show (1986)_ (qv).  Due to her ability to read and write before the age of three, when enrolled in school she was often promoted several grades ahead of her age. Oprah at the age of six went to live with her mother, Vernita Lee. Vernita worked as a maid, so Oprah was often left alone at home with her cousins. Oprah due to her busy mother was paid little attention to at home, this is what prompted Oprah to started misbehaving and talking back to her mother. Vernita Lee then decided it was best Oprah live with her father in Nashville Tennessee. Oprah while living in Tennessee, found out her mother was pregnant and her mother requested for her to come back to Milwaukee to live with her mother and half-sister. When Oprah was nine she was raped by her nineteen year old cousin who was baby sitting her. This wouldn't be the only time she was sexually abused she would then be sexually abused by her cousin, a family friend,her mother's boyfriend, and her uncle during her stay in Milwaukee. Toward all these incidents, she never told a soul because the predators swore her to silence. At the age of thirteen Oprah ran away from home, this was due to her years of abuse and at the age of fourteen she became pregnant with an ill son who died shortly after birth. Oprah took the death of her son as she was given a second chance in life. Oprah's mother sent her to live once again with her father in Nashville,Tennessee. Oprah's father was very strict and made education the number-one priority for Oprah.  Oprah attended Nashville East High School. Oprah during high-school wasn't precisely certain toward what she wanted to do, however she knew it was something with speaking or drama. Oprah was also elected school president and met with president 'Richard Nixon' (qv) being apart of public speaking classes in her high-school.  Oprah during the last year of high-school was rehearsing with her drama class when a local radio station, WVOL spotted her and asked her if she would like to read on radio. Oprah was then given a job reading the news on the radio. Oprah soon entered into a public speaking contest where the grand prize was a scholarship to Tennessee State University. Oprah won the contest and received a scholarship to Tennessee State University where she majored in Speech Communications and Performing Arts.  Oprah during her college education was offered a job as a co-anchor on the CBS television station, she declined several times before she was convinced by her speech professor that it may be the ultimate step to launch her career. Oprah wanted to find work outside of Nashville Tennessee and was soon offered a job in Baltimore,Maryland. The job offer came up a few months before her graduation, she had to choose between the job and graduating, so she decided to choose the job in Maryland as the offer was very tempting. At the job in Maryland she wasn't a very good reporter and was shortly fired. Oprah's boss set her up as a talk show host on a morning talk show called, _People Are Talking (1978)_ (qv). Immediately after the first show Oprah knew this is what she wanted to do for the rest of her life. Oprah strengthened the talk show for seven years and then she decided it was time to move on.  In 1981 Oprah sent recorded tapes of the show to a talk-show in Chicago called A.M. Chicago.

Michelle joined the cast of The Young and the Restless in 1994 and has since developed her role of Phyllis into one of the most popular and vivacious characters on daytime to date.  Michelle's career began when a modeling opportunity presented itself, taking her to such far-away destinations as Japan, France and Italy. After living in Italy for a year, which, in her own words brought me out of my conservative shell, Michelle discovered within herself a previously dormant desire to act. So back to the U.S. it was for this now Italian-speaking beauty where she wasted no time submerging herself in the Hollywood auditioning process.  Michelle's first job, the teen afternoon soap opera _Tribes (1990)_ (qv), was followed by several commercials and TV show guest appearances and culminated in her starring in two plays directed by Academy Award®-nominated and Tony Award®-winning actor 'Charles Durning' (qv). And in one of his plays, Savage in Limbo, the Los Angeles Times touted Michelle as the sensational Michelle Stafford. But it was when Michelle nabbed the role of Phyllis on _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv) that her career took its biggest stride. The producers initially intended the character to come and leave quickly but, after only one month, Michelle had created such a stir that they knew they could not let her go. And, within her first two years on the show, her talent had earned her an Emmy® for Best Supporting Actress and two consecutive Soap Opera Digest Awards. Michelle went on to star in 'Aaron Spelling' (qv)'s drama _Pacific Palisades (1997)_ (qv), guest-starred on 'Dick Wolf (I)' (qv)'s _Players (1997)_ (qv), _Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998)_ (qv), _JAG (1995)_ (qv), _Diagnosis Murder (1993)_ (qv), _Judging Amy (1999)_ (qv), _Frasier (1993)_ (qv) and had a recurring role on 'Pamela Anderson (I)' (qv)'s _V.I.P. (1998)_ (qv). She also worked opposite 'Ashley Judd' (qv) in the popular film _Double Jeopardy (1999)_ (qv), directed by the acclaimed 'Bruce Beresford' (qv) and starred in the psychological thriller _Attraction (2000)_ (qv), opposite 'Tom Everett Scott' (qv). And it was when Michelle returned to _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv) that she won her second Emmy®, this time for Best Lead Actress. As an ardent sports fan, it seemed only appropriate that Michelle serve as the Best Damn Stanley Cup correspondent on Fox Sports' _The Best Damn Sports Show Period (2001)_ (qv) - much to the hosts' delight. And, more recently, Michelle has contributed her commentary on the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs as a celebrity blogger on NHL.com.  In April 2008, Stafford nabbed her seventh Emmy nomination and was projected by 'Mark Dagostino' (qv) of People Magazine as his pick to win.  While The outrageously sexy Stafford (TV Guide) continues her celebrated run on _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv), she also constantly keeps busy with additional projects. Michelle recently tried her hand at portraying a detective in the soon-to-be released feature-film _3 Days Gone (2008) (V)_ (qv). And, in 2007, starred in the Lifetime television movie _Like Mother, Like Daughter (2007) (TV)_ (qv). With all of the above, Michelle still finds time for some of her more personal interests, including travel, the culinary world and philanthropic endeavors.  Michelle lends her voice and time to such groups as Citizens Commission on Human Rights and The Hollywood Education and Literacy Project and was honored by the National Foundation for Women Legislators for her human rights campaigning."], "birthnotes": ["Chicago, Illinois, USA"], "birthdate": ["14 September 1965"], "height": ["5' 7"], "otherworks": ["TV commercial for the 2006 Toyota Camry (2006)", "TV commercial for Herbal Essences Shampoo (2001)"], "interviews": ["TV Guide (USA), 16 August 2003, Vol. 51, Iss. 33, pg. 46, by: Michael Logan, The Best Damned Part-Time Job Period", "Soap World (Australia), 25 October 2004, by: Adele Heydenrich", "TV Guide (USA), 15 July 2000, Vol. 48, Iss. 29, pg. 44, by: Michael Logan, Return Engagement"], "article": ["PAWprint (USA), 2007, Iss. 6, pg. 41, by: Lindsay Crolius, Spotlight", "First For Women (USA), 27 January 2007, pg. 2, by: Bonnie Siegler, Stress Solutions", "Country Weekly (USA), 14 January 2008, by: Pat Gallagher, I Love My Country", "Variety (USA), 1 December 2007, by: Variety Staff, Pushy Questions For...", "OK! magazine (USA), 26 February 2007, pg. 85, by: Delaina Dixon, TV Addict"], "magazinecoverphoto": ["Soap Opera Digest (USA), 2 January 2007", "CBS Soaps In Depth (USA), 15 May 2007", "Soap Opera Digest (USA), 12 June 2007", "CBS Soaps In Depth (USA), 12 June 2007", "Soap Opera Digest (USA), 11 April 2006", "CBS Soaps In Depth (USA), 26 December 2006", "CBS Soaps In Depth (USA), 12 May 2008", "American Fitness (USA), 1 July 2007", "ABC Soaps In Depth (USA), 21 July 2014", "Soap Opera Weekly (USA), 14 January 1997", "Soap Opera Digest (USA), 14 January 1997", "Soap Opera Digest (USA), 19 June 2007", "CBS Soaps In Depth (USA), 7 August 2007", "CBS Soaps In Depth (USA), 4 September 2007"], "pictorial": ["Soap Opera Digest (USA), 24 September 2002, Vol. 27, Iss. 39, pg. 56-58, by: Carolyn Hinsey, A day in the life of Michelle Stafford", "First For Women (USA), 1 October 2007, pg. 6, Who Wore It Slimmer?"] } }

He studied acting at Syracuse University and, after graduating, landed a job on Wall Street. Following the Wall Street crash of 1929, he found himself unemployed and resolved to become a professional actor on the stage. The road was hard, since it took him five years to first appear on Broadway in Hotel Alimony (1934). While this production was universally slammed by the critics, the next plays he appeared in, Having Wonderful Time (1937) and Kiss the Boys Goodbye (1938), were unqualified successes, the former running for 372 performances.  Movie offers followed, and from 1939 he became one of Hollywood's most recognizable screen tough guys, the names of his characters evocative of the roles he played: Pretty Willie in _Tall, Dark and Handsome (1941)_ (qv), Slip Moran in _Lucky Jordan (1942)_ (qv), Lippy Harris in _Jinx Money (1948)_ (qv), Jumbo Schneider in _Money from Home (1953)_ (qv) and, famously, Harry the Horse in _Guys and Dolls (1955)_ (qv). There was also an assortment of minor henchmen and western heavies named Blackie or Lefty, and he was Nick, the sneering, humorless barkeeper who tosses 'James Stewart (I)' (qv) into the snow in _It's a Wonderful Life (1946)_ (qv).  Having had his fill of acting in those kinds of parts, Leonard began a new career as a television producer in the 1950s and went on to become one of the most successful TV producer/directors of the 1950s and 1960s. Four of his productions (all on CBS)--_Make Room for Daddy (1953)_ (qv), _Gomer Pyle: USMC (1964)_ (qv), _The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961)_ (qv) (which won 21 Emmy Awards) and _The Andy Griffith Show (1960)_ (qv)--were rated in the Top Ten. He had a further success with _I Spy (1965)_ (qv), championing the cause of racial equality over the (initial) objections of the network by being the first series to have an African-American ('Bill Cosby' (qv)) in an equal co-starring dramatic role with a white actor.

I'd love to play him again. He's such a great character. I'm glad they brought him in for that one, but it's a shame we didn't get to see more of Hank. Then they moved to the prequel and everybody got young. [laughs] But it's all right... I hadn't followed X-Men so much, but when I played the role, I got so much response from people about how excited they were. I think there was just a gap in the market.

But then we broke another story with Casey-Angell-Lee [writer-producers 'Peter Casey (I)' (qv), 'David Angell (I)' (qv) and 'David Lee (V)' (qv)], and they wrote a great script about a completely different character. And it was [Paramount TV head] John Pike who was responsible for Frasier. He's the one who sat me down and said, I think a sitcom should be funny, and the script you guys turned in is not. [laughs] I want you to do Frasier. So I said, Okay, well, there's a couple of conditions: he's not married, and I don't want any kids in there. So we found the devices to get as far away from Boston as we could, and people made an attempt to make sure this was a new guy with an old but recognizable name.

He's funny enough to keep around. He makes things funny that we didn't think were funny, and that's an asset to the show. So they found a way to have him be part of it... You know, one of my favorite episodes of playing Frasier on _Cheers (1982)_ (qv) was one I think was called _Cheers (1982) {The Triangle (#4.15)}_ (qv), when he actually started to do therapy on Sam and Diane and sort of ended up examining himself in the process, and had the big blowout in Sam's office with the two of them.

We got the process down to an hour and a half for most of it, so it was only three hours total. So it wasn't brutal. It was just the prep.

After working as a mule skinner, wrangler and gold prospector, among other things, he wound up in Hollywood and began picking up jobs as an extra in comedies, where he met comedian 'Harold Lloyd (I)' (qv) in 1913 in San Diego. By all accounts, including his own, he was a terrible actor, but he saw a future in the movie business and in Harold Lloyd. Roach came into a small inheritance and began producing, directing and writing a series of short film comedies, under the banner of Phun Philms (soon changed to Rolin, which lasted until 1922), starring Lloyd in early 1915. Initially these were abysmal, but with tremendous effort, the quality improved enough to be nominally financed and distributed by Pathe, which purchased Roach's product by the exposed foot of film. The Roach/Lloyd team morphed through two characters. The first, nominally tagged as Will E. Work, proved hopeless; the second, Lonesome Luke, an unabashed imitation of 'Charles Chaplin' (qv), proved more successful with each new release. Lloyd's increasing dissatisfaction with the Chaplin clone character irritated Roach to no end, and the two men engaged in a series of battles, walkouts and reconciliations. Ultimately Lloyd abandoned the character completely in 1917, creating his now-famous Glasses character, which met with even greater box-office success, much to the relief of Roach and Pathe. This new character hit a nerve with the post-war public as both the antithesis and complement to Chaplin, capturing the can-do optimism of the age. This enabled Roach to renegotiate the deal with Pathe and start his own production company, putting his little studio on a firm financial foundation. Hal Roach Productions became a unique entity in Hollywood. It operated as a sort of paternalistic boutique studio, releasing a surprising number of wildly popular shorts series and a handful of features. Quality was seldom compromised and his employees were treated as his most valuable asset.  Roach's relationship with his biggest earner was increasingly acrimonious after 1920 (among other things, Lloyd would bristle at Roach's demands to appear at the studio daily regardless of his production schedule). After achieving enormous success with features (interestingly, his only real feature flop of the 1930s was with _General Spanky (1936)_ (qv), a very poorly conceived vehicle for the property), Lloyd had achieved superstar status by the standards of The Roaring Twenties and wanted his independence. The two men severed ties, with Roach retaining re-issue rights for Lloyd's shorts for the remainder of the decade. While both men built their careers together, it was Lloyd who first recognized his need for creative freedom, no longer needing Roach's financial support. This realization irked Roach, and from this point forward he found it difficult, if not impossible, to offer unadulterated praise for his former friend and star (while Lloyd himself was far more generous in his later praise of Roach, he, too, could be critical, if more accurate, in his recollections). Lloyd went on to much greater financial success at Paramount.  Despite facing the prospect of losing his biggest earner, Roach was already preoccupied with building his kiddie comedy series, Our Gang, which became an immediate hit with the public. By the time he turned 25 in 1917, Roach was wealthy and increasingly spending time away from his studio. He traveled extensively across Europe. By the early 1920s he had eclipsed 'Mack Sennett' (qv) as the King of Comedy and created many of the most memorable comic series of all time. These included the team of 'Stan Laurel' (qv) and 'Oliver Hardy' (qv), 'Charley Chase (I)' (qv), 'Edgar Kennedy' (qv), ''Snub' Pollard' (qv) and especially the long-running Our Gang series (AKA The Little Rascals in TV distribution). Pathe, which distributed his films, shut down its U.S. operations after its domestic representative, Paul Brunet, returned to France in 1927. But Roach was able to secure an even better deal with MGM (his key competitor, Mack Sennett, was also distributed by Pathe, but he was unable to land a deal, ultimately declaring bankruptcy in 1933). For the next eleven years Roach shored up MGM's bottom line, although the deal was probably more beneficial to Roach. In the mid-'30s Roach became inexplicably enamored of 'Benito Mussolini', and sought to secure a business alliance with the fascist dictator's recently completed film complex, Cinecitta. After Roach asked for (and received) assurances from Mussolini that Italy wasn't about to seek sanctions against the Jews, the two men formed RAM (Roach And Mussolini) Productions, a move that appalled the powers at MGM parent company, Leow's Inc. These events coincided with Roach selling off Our Gang to MGM and committing himself solely to feature film production. In September 1937, Il Duce's son, 'Vittorio Mussolini' (qv), visited Hollywood and Roach's studio threw a lavish party celebrating his 21st birthday. Soon afterward the Italian government took on an increasingly anti-Semitic stance and, in retribution, Leow's chairman 'Nicholas Schenck' (qv) canceled his distribution deal. Roach signed an adequate deal with United Artists in May 1938 and redeemed his previous record of feature misfires with a string of big hits: _Topper (1937)_ (qv) (and its lesser sequels), the prestigious _Of Mice and Men (1939)_ (qv) and, most significantly, _One Million B.C. (1940)_ (qv), which became the most profitable movie of the year. Despite the nearly unanimous condemnation by his industry peers, Roach stubbornly refused to re-examine his attitudes over his dealings with Mussolini, even in the aftermath of World War II (he proudly displayed an autographed portrait of the dictator in his home up until his death). His tried-and-true formula for success was tested by audience demands for longer feature-length productions, and by the early 1940s he was forced to try his hand at making low-budget, full-length screwball comedies, musicals and dramas, although he still kept turning out extended two-reel-plus comedies, which he tagged as streamliners; they failed to catch on with post-war audiences. By the 1950s he was producing mainly for television (_My Little Margie (1952)_ (qv), _Blondie (1957)_ (qv) and _The Gale Storm Show: Oh! Susanna (1956)_ (qv), for example). His willingness to delve into TV production flew in the face of most of the major Hollywood studios of the day. He made a stab at retirement but his son, 'Hal Roach Jr.' (qv), proved an inept businessman and drove the studio to the brink of bankruptcy by 1959. Roach returned and focused on facilities leasing and managing the TV rights of his film catalog.  In 1983 his company developed the first successful digital colorization process. Roach then became a producer for many TV series on the Disney Channel, and his company still produces most of their films and videos.

To stay with someone when you no longer have anything in common is the cruelest thing to do to a child. It's much better to divorce and have two parents happy. I don't know if Charles Ingalls would have stayed married to Caroline as long as he did, except that it was a long way to the next house in those days. I was not an aging lecher looking for a fresh young thing. You don't dissolve a relationship to go to bed with someone twenty years younger. You have to have major differences to stop a relationship, after as many years as I was married. With a wife and seven children, there's always a problem. Lynn and I fought a lot, about jealousy, about my being tied up with my work. I'd go into depressed moods, and then I'd go around screaming at people at home and in the studio - and at everyone in sight. Banging down phones, swearing and yelling.

In 1941, he and his family moved to Collingswood, New Jersey.  When Eugene was in high school, he participated -- and did very well -- in track and field, especially javelin throwing, and his athletic skills earned him a scholarship to USC. However, an accident injured his arm, ending his athletic career -- and his term at USC -- and he worked a number of odd jobs and small roles to make ends meet and decided that acting was for him. However, he thought that his real name was not a suitable one for an aspiring actor, and so Michael Landon was born.  Two of his first big roles were as Tony Rivers in _I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957)_ (qv) and as Tom Dooley in the western _The Legend of Tom Dooley (1959)_ (qv). That same year he was approached by producer 'David Dortort' (qv) to star in a pilot called _The Restless Gun (1957)_ (qv), which was renamed when the series was picked up to _Bonanza (1959)_ (qv). Landon played Little Joe Cartwright, the youngest of the three Cartwright brothers, a cocky and somewhat rebellious youth nevertheless had a way with the ladies. For 14 years, Landon became the heart and soul of the show, endearing himself to both younger and older viewers, and he became a household name during the 1960s and 1970s.  In 1968, after almost ten years of playing Little Joe, he wanted an opportunity to direct and write some episodes of the show. After the season finale in 1972, 'Dan Blocker' (qv), who played his older brother Hoss and was also a close friend, died from a blood clot in his lung, after gall bladder surgery, but Michael decided to go back to work, revisiting his own character in a two-part episode called Forever.  _Bonanza (1959)_ (qv) was finally canceled in early 1973, after 14 years and 430 episodes. Michael didn't have to wait long until he landed another successful role that most TV audiences of the 1970s would thoroughly enjoy, his second TV western, for NBC, _Little House on the Prairie (1974)_ (qv). That show was based on a popular book written by 'Laura Ingalls Wilder' (qv), and he played enduring patriarch and farmer Charles Ingalls. Unlike _Bonanza (1959)_ (qv), where he was mostly just a hired gun, on this show he served as the producer, writer, director, and executive producer. By the end of its eighth season in 1982, Landon decided to step down from his role on Little House as he saw his TV children grown up and moved out of their father's house, and a year later, the show was canceled. After 14 years on _Bonanza (1959)_ (qv) and 8 years on _Little House on the Prairie (1974)_ (qv), it was about time to focus on something else, and once again, he didn't have to wait too long before _Highway to Heaven (1984)_ (qv) came along. Unlike the western shows that he did for 23 years, this NBC fantasy/drama show focused on Jonathan Smith, an angel whose job was to save peoples' lives and work for God, his boss. 'Victor French' (qv) played ex-cop Mark Gordon, who turned down a fortune but had redeemed himself by meeting Jonathan.  By the end of the fifth season in 1989, French was diagnosed with lung cancer and died in June of that same year. Landon was devastated by the loss and pulled the plug on _Highway to Heaven (1984)_ (qv). In early 1991, after 35 years of working on NBC, he was axed by the network, so he moved to CBS to star in the pilot of a two-hour movie, _Us (1991) (TV)_ (qv), in which he played Jeff Hayes, a man freed from prison by new evidence after 18 years wrongfully spent inside. This was going to be another one of Landon's shows but, in April 1991, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He later appeared on _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)_ (qv) to talk about his battle with the disease, and many people in the audience were affected by the courage and energy he showed. Unfortunately, he was already terminally ill by that time, and on Monday, July 1st, 1991, after a three-month battle, he finally succumbed to the disease. His family, his colleagues, and his children were all by his side.

Okay, now first of all, it was a joke, okay? We were in a comedic context. I said, He used to be a Nazi, and he wears funny hats, and ladies, he's single. So, right away, we're in the context of a joke, okay, and used to. Okay, but, you know, you got me. The Pope was not a Nazi.

I wouldn't blame any teen, he was a fourteen-year-old kid in Nazi Germany, of course he's going to do what they tell him to do. So, on that score, you know what my Catholic friends, I will never make the Pope is a Nazi joke again, because you're technically right, okay, and also because it distracts from the main point. And the main point I was making was that if the Pope instead of a religious figure was the CEO of a chain of nationwide daycare centers, who had thousands of employees who had been caught molesting children and then covering it up, he would have been in jail.

Maher was raised in his father's Catholic faith. While attending Cornell University, he decided to try stand-up comedy. His first stand-up routine was in a Chinese restaurant on Route 17 in Paramus, NJ. He soon landed a regular gig at Catch a Rising Star in New York City. After a few years, he became a regular host at the club and was spotted by a scout for _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)_ (qv). Maher made numerous appearances on the show, and Carson had been a hero of his since childhood, but he always felt constrained by the rules of network television. During this time, he appeared in films and made guest appearances on numerous sitcoms.  In 1993, Maher was offered his own talk show by Comedy Central. Maher developed the show as a round table discussion on current events. _Politically Incorrect (1993)_ (qv) premiered to critical acclaim and attracted major celebrities as well as politicians and pundits. In 1997, the show moved to ABC where it aired to continued success. On September 17, 2001, Maher made controversial comments regarding the terrorists who orchestrated the September 11 attack on the US. Sponsors pulled their ads and affiliates refused to air the show. ABC canceled the show in 2002, citing low ratings. Maher had been nominated for 11 Emmys for his work on the show.

His father left home before he was born; Webb would never know him. He was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother in dire poverty that preceded the Depression. Making things worse, Webb suffered from acute asthma from age six until adulthood, somewhat surprising for a man whose cigarette intake reached three packs a day at its peak. Webb's great love was movies, and his dream was to direct them. He began in radio, first as a disc jockey then as host of a comedy show (Believe It or Not!), finally as Pat Novak, Private Eye, his first true success. A small role in the film nor classic _He Walked by Night (1948)_ (qv) led to the creation of Dragnet. During production, Webb befriended a LAPD police consultant assigned to the film and became fascinated with the cases he heard told. He successfully pitched the idea of a radio series to NBC using stories drawn from actual LAPD files. Dragnet first aired over NBC radio on June 3, 1949, and came to TV (_Dragnet (1951)_ (qv)) on December 16, 1951. The show was one of the monster hits of early TV and was honored with satirizations by comics and even Bugs Bunny (!) during it's run, which lasted until September, 1959. The series' popularity could have ensured its continuation indefinitely but, by then, Webb had become a film director and would helm (and star in) five features: _Dragnet (1954)_ (qv), _Pete Kelly's Blues (1955)_ (qv), _The D.I. (1957)_ (qv), _-30- (1959)_ (qv) and _The Last Time I Saw Archie (1961)_ (qv). The last two were box office flops, and Webb returned to TV in 1962. In February, 1963, he became Head of Production for Warner Bros. Television, a job he was fired from that December when his revision of _77 Sunset Strip (1958)_ (qv) sent its ratings into a death spiral. After two years of unemployment, a new opportunity arose, the made-for-TV film, of which Universal was then sole supplier. Coincidentally, they owned the rights to _Dragnet (1951)_ (qv) and invited Webb to do a new Dragnet as a TV movie. It turned out so well in industry previews (oddly not broadcast until 1969) that NBC and Universal persuaded him to do a new _Dragnet 1967 (1967)_ (qv) TV series, which lasted three-and-a-half seasons and went on to smash success in syndicated reruns. This later incarnation (co-starring 'Harry Morgan (I)' (qv) as Officer Bill Gannon) is probably what Webb is best known for and unlike the 50's version, it was produced in color and increasingly focused on his personal conservative social agenda. Over the next five seasons, he regularly blasted marijuana, LSD (which was legal at the time of the revamped series debut), hippies, juvenile delinquency and disrespect for law enforcement. To be fair, the series was equally intolerant of police corruption and went to great lengths to show LAPD's self-disciplinary process as it was at the time. Webb was known as an extremely economical TV producer: his Mark VII productions routinely used minimal sets, even more minimal wardrobes (Friday and Gannon seem to wear the same suits over entire seasons, which minimized continuity issues) and maintained a relatively tight-knit stock company that consisted of scale-paid regulars who routinely appeared as irate crime victims, policewomen, miscreants and clueless parents of misguided youth. While the passing decades haven't been kind to all of the episodes--- several now seem camp, the manpower expended investigating some seemingly minor crimes is laughable and the outcome of many of the trials would be vastly different today--- they remain entertaining while representing somewhat fictionalized docudramas 1960's police operations. With renewed wealth and industry status, Webb was also determined not to repeat his past debacle as a producer/studio boss. He parlayed Dragnet's renewed popularity into a second hit series, _Adam-12 (1968)_ (qv), and scored an even bigger hit with _Emergency! (1972)_ (qv) (casting his ex-wife, 'Julie London' (qv) and her husband 'Bobby Troup' (qv)), a show that inspired thousands of kids to become EMT/paramedics for generations, perhaps Webb's greatest legacy. During the production of _Dragnet 1967 (1967)_ (qv), he maintained a rigorous daily work schedule while ignoring his health. He loved chili dogs and cigarettes, enjoyed late nights playing cards and drinking with cast members who were amazed to find him fully alert at 7a.m. the next day, expecting the same from them. The combined effect of this lifestyle made him appear older than he actually was by the late 60's. Unbeknownst to fans, he possessed a healthy sense of humor (his 1968 Copper Clapper appearance on _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962)_ (qv) remains a classic) and he was a jazz fanatic, amassing one of the world's greatest collections. Webb's sense of humor didn't extend to his self-image, however. In 1977, director 'John Landis (I)' (qv) approached him with an offer to appear as Dean Wormer in _Animal House (1978)_ (qv) and recalled Webb sitting stone-faced and unimpressed at the offer. Sadly, he rejected it as being too counter to his public persona. Webb managed to keep his company solvent until his untimely, yet not unexpected, death from a massive heart attack on December 23, 1982 at age 62. Webb was married four times: to 'Julie London' (qv) (1947-54), Dorothy Towne (1955-1957), 'Jackie Loughery' (qv) (1958-64), and to Opal Wright (1980-death).

An outgoing only child, by age three Adrienne Danielle Frantz was holding private dance recitals in her hometown of Mount Clemens, Michigan. In spite of a busy schedule of dance, voice and theater classes, Frantz managed to graduate from high school at age sixteen and promptly packed her bags and headed off to New York City in search of her dreams - and never looked back. While enrolled in her freshman year at Marymount College in New York City, Frantz won the role of Tiffany Thorne on 'Aaron Spelling' (qv)'s new NBC soap-opera _Sunset Beach (1997)_ (qv) and moved to Los Angeles. Within a few months she jumped ship from a struggling to join one of the most-watched shows around the globe: producer/writer 'Bradley Bell (I)' (qv) hired her for the plum part of the scheming, yet vulnerable, Amber Moore on _The Bold and the Beautiful (1987)_ (qv). Debuting as a supporting character alongside villainess Sheila Carter ('Kimberlin Brown' (qv)) in July 1997 Amber was soon linked to the mighty Forrester fashion dynasty and kicked off the next generation teen set in 1998. Eventually, family members of Amber were introduced and the love story of Amber and Rick Forrester (played by 'Jacob Young (II)' (qv) and later 'Justin Torkildsen' (qv)) was a tent pole of the show in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2003, for a short while Frantz was pulling double duty when the part of Amber's twin sister April was created. Frantz was awarded with an Emmy as 'Outstanding Younger Actress' in 2001 (with additional nominations in 2000 and 2003). In 2005 she opted on leaving the show, but the character of Amber didn't disappear for too long. In late 2006 Amber Moore returned - but this time around on _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv) where head-writer 'Lynn Marie Latham' (qv) was a self-proclaimed fan of the actress. Akin to her debut on The Bold And The Beautiful ten years earlier, Amber was again quickly linked to the important players in Genoa City. She stayed with the show until May 2010 before returning to B&B some weeks later. Frantz second run in fictional Los Angeles started off strong but then fizzled. So in 2012, Frantz opted on leaving The Bold And The Beautiful to start a new chapter in her life: attending classes to become a stand-up-comedian. Since the age of 16, Frantz has been belting out her own self-written tunes. A music executive noticed her talents at a charity event and quickly enlisted her demo tape to A&R executives at several major record labels. Her efforts resulted in Best Female Vocalist honors for 1997 at the Los Angeles International Music Awards. Several B&B episodes have showcased Frantz's original songs, and she was tapped to co-write and perform the title song on the film _Jimmy Zip (1996)_ (qv). In addition to her soap roles, Frantz also did voice-work on _The Wild Thornberrys (1998)_ (qv) and starred in _Speedway Junky (1999)_ (qv) - 'Gus Van Sant' (qv)'s dark tale of runaway kids living on the streets of Las Vegas - with 'Jonathan Taylor Thomas (I)' (qv) and 'Tiffani Thiessen' (qv). For many years, Frantz has been staunch supporter of various animal and health welfare organizations.

Prior to this he had become a noted singer/actor on the Broadway stage and in night clubs. Born William Foster Hayes III in Harvey, Illinois, on June 5, 1925, and raised in the Midwest, his father was a bookseller (for 41 years). He got his talent from his dad who enjoyed singing and local community theater performing on the sly. Bill entered WWII as a naval airman, then studied at De Pauw University, where he met and married first wife Mary. They went on to have five children. He later received his master's degree at Northwestern. Blessed with a sturdy tenor, his interest in a professional career was piqued after happening upon a tour of Carousel in 1947. From singing telegrams to barbershop quartets to choir directing to jazz group vocals, Bill persevered musically until earning his first big break on TV. A lead singing/stooge role in Olsen & Johnson's zany burlesque revue Funzapoppin' in 1949 led to him joining the pair on their short-lived TV show and, ultimately, his resident crooning on _Your Show of Shows (1950)_ (qv) starring 'Sid Caesar' (qv) and 'Imogene Coca' (qv). In the meantime he also performed in vaudeville and broke into films with a supporting role in _Stop, You're Killing Me (1952)_ (qv). Despite a wife and family to support, he left the show on his own volition for the chance to star in a new Broadway musical. Me and Juliet opened with moderate success in 1953 and lasted over a year, touring with the show in its aftermath. Bill also happened to record The Ballad of Davey Crockett, which became a surprise #1 Billboard hit and sold over three million copies. A nightclub and TV-variety fixture in the late 1950s, he later managed to flex his vocal chords in such musicals as Bye Bye Birdie (national tour), Brigadoon, The Pajama Game and George M! The 1960s were a slow, difficult time for Bill professionally and personally, which culminated in the breakup of his marriage. Luck and talent played a part when he was hired to join the cast of _Days of Our Lives (1965)_ (qv) playing the role of Doug Williams. The character was originally a louse and con artist, but grew more reputable after his character fell in love with feisty troublemaker Julie Olson, played by Susan Seaforth. Their seesaw romantic relationship became one of daytime's top story lines of the 1970s. Off-screen the couple also ignited sparks and, despite their major age difference (she is 18 years his junior), they married on October 12, 1974. In 1984, after 14 years and two daytime Emmy nominations, he and Susan left the show due to their dwindling status. While Susan went on to join the cast of _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv) the following year, Bill refocused on his singing by performing on the cabaret circuit and recording a few albums. The couple returned on and off to their soap opera alma mater over the years, but in 1999 they became part of the regular cast again with a stronger story line. Bill is still performing on stage, more recently playing Beauregard in Mame and with his wife in productions of A Christmas Carol, Love Letters and Same Time, Another Year, which is a sequel to Same Time, Next Year."], "birthnotes": ["Harvey, Illinois, USA"], "birthdate": ["5 June 1925"], "height": ["5' 9"], "spouse": ["'Susan Seaforth Hayes' (qv) (12 October 1974 - present)", "'Mary Hobbs' (February 1947 - 1969) (divorced); 5 children"], "otherworks": ["(1957) TV commercial (w/'Florence Henderson (I)' (qv)): 1957 Oldsmobile.", "(April 20-30, 1953) He acted in Richard Rodgers, George Abbott, and Oscar Hammerstein's musical, Me and Juliet, in a world premiere at the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland, Ohio with Ray Walston, Isabel Bigley and Joan McCracken in the cast.

She possesses beauty, brains, talent and a passion for acting.  When Heather was only 16, she won an Emmy Award for her portrayal of the tempestuous, troubled and oft-married Victoria Newman. Last year Heather became the most nominated actress in her category, receiving her 8th consecutive Emmy nomination. Heather has won the Emmy award twice (1993, 1999). The title was especially sweet because her brother 'David Tom (I)' (qv) (Billy Abbott on _The Young and the Restless (1973)_ (qv)) also received his first nomination. In 1997, Heather won Best Younger Leading Actress at the Soap Opera Digest Awards. With her best friend 'Chad Allen (I)' (qv) (_Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (1993)_ (qv)), Heather has moved into the role of theatrical producer, successfully producing a revival of 'Neil Simon (I)' (qv)'s Biloxi Blues as well as appearing in the play as Daisy. The revival was so well received that it has won 5 Dramalogue Awards. Quite an accomplishment for a fledgling producer! Recently, Heather produced and starred in Gila, a play by 'Mark Medoff' (qv) (_Children of a Lesser God (1986)_ (qv)) and starring Phyllis Freilich, which received rave reviews. For this role, Heather had to be fluent in sign language. Her talent overwhelmed audiences once again, earning Heather a Robbie Theatre L.A. Award nomination for Best Actress. Heather's love for acting and theatre is life long. A commercial actress at the age of two, Heather was dancing with the Seattle Pacific Ballet at age 10. By the time she was 13, Heather and her actor-siblings 'Nicholle Tom' (qv) (_The Nanny (1993)_ (qv)) and David were ready to break into Hollywood. They made a temporary, trial-run move to Los Angeles, found work immediately and turned an out-of-town tryout into a long-running hit. Her natural talent and ability got her started; her hard work, determination and intelligence keep her working. As a young actress, Heather took acting classes at the Young Actor's Space, paying for each weekly session with the money she earned working at a local cookie shop. A focused, dedicated and giving performer, Heather landed guest appearances on many hot shows, including _Kids Incorporated (1984)_ (qv) and _Who's the Boss? (1984)_ (qv) She has co-starred in two movies of the week, ABC-TV's _She'll Take Romance (1990) (TV)_ (qv) and CBS-TV's _Deadly Whispers (1995) (TV)_ (qv) and has starred in the feature films Lessie's Rainbow and Lookin Good. For Heather, acting is more than playing a part. As she describes it, the feeling of losing the audience for a moment and truly becoming connected with the scene and the character is absolutely incredible. Recognizing that she is fortunate to be not only a beautiful and talented actress but also a working actress, Heather is devoted to helping people who do not have the opportunities or options that she has. Recently Heather was named Regional Ambassador for Childhelp USA, a national non-profit organization that assists abused children. Heather also works very closely with several AIDS service organizations such as Caring for Babies with AIDS, Project Angelfood, Tuesday's Child and AIDS Project Los Angeles. She has volunteered in the kitchen at Project Angelfood helping to prepare meals for those who are disabled by AIDS many times as well as appearing and working at fund-raisers for many organizations. Her acting career and charity works are only two of Heather's passions. Politics could easily tie for first or second place in her affections. Heather loves to discuss politics, but she does more than talk the talk. In the Congressional elections, Heather worked very closely with Congressman 'Loretta Sanchez (II)' (qv)' campaign as well as with Rock the Vote to help get out the younger voters. Heather also spends hours reading plays, scripts and classical literature. She is also an avid art collector who has amassed an impressive collection of sculpture, painting and prints. Theatre is where Heather's heart is and, as her career progresses, she has her sights set on Broadway. While she awaits her chance to trod the boards of the great white way, Heather and Chad Allen tour the country sharing the gift of their talent and experience by teaching young, aspiring actors improvisation, scene study and on-camera work. Intelligent, educated, talented, ambitious, determined and caring.

He was born into a classic Irish Catholic family and attended private Catholic schools.  O'Reilly attended Marist College and studied history. Bill was also in the football club as a punter and wrote for the school newspaper. O'Reilly studied abroad at the University of London, and after coming home played semi professional baseball before graduating with a bachelors in history in 1971.  O'Reilly studied broadcast journalism at Boston University after some time as a teacher in Florida. O'Reilly interned with different newspapers and stations while earning his masters. In the mid 90's O'Reilly earned a degree from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. O'Reilly's early career included anchor jobs in Scranton, Denver, Portland, Hartford, and Boston. In this time he won a local Emmy and was praised for excellence in investigative reporting.  O'Reilly worked as a WEBS anchor and won a second local Emmy before earning the spot of correspondent for CBS network news. He later worked as a correspondent and assignment reporter for ABC.  O'Reilly became a news star when he was an anchor on Inside Addition where he covered the fall of the Berlin Wall and the murder of Joel Steinberg. After leaving the team, he earned his 3rd degree from the Kennedy School of government in 1995.  In 1996, O'Reilly launched The O'Reilly Factor the show he has anchored for 17 years. Since then he has used his show to report top political stories and it has become the #1 Cable News Show on TV.  In addition to reporting the news, O'Reilly often dissects it. He has made accusations against organizations and figures for corruption, and has broke barriers in news. He often goes head to head with organizations, politicians, and celebrities in the social media. He has called out judges for court rulings he found to be poor and he has even accused people of being unamerican.  One of his most famous organization rivals is the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union)In 1997, 10 year old Jeffery Curley was kidnapped by two men and murdered. His body was molested and dumped off. The two men claimed they had gotten the inspiration from literature they had read in a library from the NAMBLA, a radical organization that condones male on boy rape and sexual contact. The ACLU then defended the NAMBLA and the men responsible. Outraged, O'Reilly used his media power to shed light on the issue.  However, his most famous head to head encounter was with organizations that raised money for 9/11 victims. Some faulty finances and numbers lead people to believe these organizations stole this money. O'Reilly publicly accused this organization and came head to head,with actor George Clooney, who claimed that O'Reilly was mistaken. Others that are often implicated as O'Reilly rivals are Michael Moore, George Soros, Alec Baldwin, and Susan Surandon. He is also playfully rivaled on late night television with comics Jon Stewart, David Letterman, and Jay Leno.  O'Reilly has some core political beliefs that lean to the right, although he is a registered Independent. O'Reilly has written books and spoken about cultual traditions such as marriage, abortion, and patriotism. He has come to conflicts with Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and George Soros on issues like these.  O'Reilly has also published books about history and politics.

Bob said Nothing. They told me to sing. I sang You Take the High Road and I'll Take the Low Road. They asked me to join the Bus Bunny chorus, and I had a few lines now and then.

Somebody's mother said to my mother They're looking for boys for Life With Father. You ought to take Donald. My mother said Do you want to go? I did, so off we went to Oscar Sirlon's office. He was the producer. I read for the part of Harlan, the littlest boy. And I got it. All my brothers were in school and, at that point, my father was not working. The company he had been selling for was absorbed by another company, and everybody was fired. My father said if I went, he would work with the stage crew. My mother couldn't go because my brothers were all in high school. So off we went - my father and I. He used to get a lot of publicity because he was the only stage father in the history of the theater at that point. I made $65 a week on the road, plus travel allowance. We traveled from coast to coast for ten months, all by train. The trains were sensational. I loved it. My father took me to every museum, every point of interest, wherever we were. There were forty-eight states then, and we covered about forty of them. The play sold out coast to coast. It was a great experience. Once, in South Bend, Indiana, our scenery got lost. It was a sell-out crowd, and the manager offered to return the tickets and cancel the performance. But the audience wouldn't let him. We went out and sang patriotic songs and entertained, and the audience watched while the crew set up the scenery when it finally arrived. They applauded the electricians and carpenters.

After immigrating to America in 1884, he spent the next decade at a series of dead-end jobs, mostly in Chicago, then worked for another 12 years at a dry-goods store in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. A salary dispute led him to quit; he returned to Chicago with hopes of acquiring a store of his own, but he bought a nickelodeon instead. Soon Laemmle had also established a film distribution business (known as a film exchange, the critical revenue mechanism at that point in the film business) that became one of the largest in America. In 1909, he produced his first picture, _Hiawatha (1909)_ (qv), a 15-minute version of 'Henry Wadsworth Longfellow' (qv)'s famous poem. By this time Laemmle had become a leader of the Independents, producers and distributors who defied the would-be monopolists of 'Thomas Edison (I)' (qv)'s Patents Company. This battle would result in dozens of film companies quickly fleeing west to escape their assets from being confiscated (a tale detailed in 'Peter Bogdanovich' (qv)'s _Nickelodeon_ ). Principal amongst those evading Edison were 'Jesse L. Lasky' (qv), 'Adolph Zukor' (qv) and Laemmle; Hollywoodland, as it was known at the time, was a perfect place to regroup and build their respective businesses. Land was cheap, too secluded for Edison's agents (and law enforcement could be made to favor the moguls' interests in those days) and weather-wise, ideal. By the end of 1912, his company operated two studios on the coast, Nestor at Sunset and Gower and Universal at Edendale. In 1914, he ordered his west coast manager, Isidore Bernstein, to buy the Taylor Ranch in Lankershim Township on the north side of the Hollywood Hills; for the princely sum of $165,000.00, Universal City was born. From it's opening in 1915 until 1925 (when eclipsed by the newly formed MGM), Laemmle's company, Universal Pictures, was the country's leading film producer. The studio could rightly boast launching the careers of a 19-year old 'Irving Thalberg' (qv)(hired as Laemmle's $35 per week private secretary and rising within months to the rank of studio manager, later to defect to Louis B. Mayer Productions. later to roll into Metro-Goldwyn Pictures), directors 'John Ford (I)' (qv), 'Jack Conway (I)' (qv), 'George Marshall (I)' (qv), 'Rex Ingram (I)' (qv) 'Lois Weber' (qv) and 'Robert Z. Leonard' (qv). It held a talented roster of stars such as 'Lon Chaney' (qv), 'Mae Murray (I)' (qv), 'Harry Carey (I)' (qv) and 'Rudolph Valentino (I)' (qv). Although Laemmle made a handful of prestige productions, such as _Blind Husbands (1919)_ (qv) and _Foolish Wives (1922)_ (qv), his output consisted mostly of low-budget westerns and melodramas, churned out in a process designed to resemble a factory. Laemmle's studio was more open than most; he virtually pioneered the concept of opening his gates to tourists from the outset. He was also famous for operating the most nepotistic studio in Hollywood for it's size. While other majors would be peppered with relatives of the top brass, at Universal nearly every one of 'Uncle' Carl's relatives had a job there, including 'Carl Laemmle Jr.' (qv), or Junior as he was known on the lot and at various times, compared favorably or unfavorably against MGM wunderkind 'Irving Thalberg' (qv). Universal's fortunes waned in the early 1930's, despite cashing in by virtually creating the talkie monster craze that remained strong from 1931 through 1935. It was Laemmle's occasional forays into quality production that caused the studio to stumble. By 1934, Carl was spending far too much money for his stockholder's to stomach, and after a costly flop with _Sutter's Gold (1936)_ (qv), he was forced to take out a $750,000 loan for the planned production of _Show Boat (1936)_ (qv) . This ended being Carl's deal with the devil; he borrowed the money from an investment consortium, Standard Capital, headed by 'Charles Rogers (I)' (qv) and J. Cheever Cowdin. Production problems with the film added another $300,000 to the budget and the loan was called. By April 2, 1936, Rogers was in and the Laemmle era was over. Ironically, Show Boat was a hit, and despite his ouster, he went out on a high note.", "The roots of Universal Pictures can rightfully be traced back to 1906 when Carl Laemmle returned home to Chicago after a stint as a bookkeeper in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and opened up a chain of nickelodeons. This in turn led to the ambitious 39-year-old organizing a film exchange network he boldly called the Laemmle Film Service, which expanded west and north into Canada. Although he was an original member of the Edison Patents Company, he bristled at the idea of paying royalties to move to the next level: film production. Laemmle founded IMP (Independent Motion Picture Company) in New York in 1909 and for the next three years produced a number of economical multi-reel films while Edison's agents did their best to shut him down. 'Thomas Edison (I)' (qv)'s General Film Company (known as The Trust) filed incessant claims of patent infringement on those companies that refused to pay. Many of these independents (which included such future film moguls as 'Adolph Zukor' (qv) and 'Jesse L. Lasky' (qv)) pulled up stakes and left for California. As for Laemmle, he doggedly fought 289 legal actions brought about by GFC from 1909-12 and was ultimately victorious. IMP reformed in 1912 as Universal, filming two final productions in New York, _The Dawn of Netta (1912)_ (qv) and a one-reeler, _The Nurse (1912/I)_ (qv), before relocating his company to Los Angeles. From 1912-14 Universal operated two California studios, one in Hollywood and the Universal Oak Crest Ranch in the San Fernando Valley. The two operations were move to the new Universal City (Taylor Ranch) in 1914 For a short time in 1912, the New York Film Company battled with Universal over the ownership of the Bison Motion Picture properties at Evendale and Santa Monica. New York Film Company wins the right to withdraw from Universal. Universal/Bison Evendale plant was returned to the New York Film Company. Universal was given the rights to trade names Bison and 101 Bison Universal/Bison brand began production at the Providencia Ranch ( Universal Oak Crest ranch- the first Universal City) in 1912.  Universal began newsreel production in 1913 under 'Jack Cohn' (qv). In 1914 Laemmle acquired the Taylor Ranch on the north side of the Hollywood Hills and set about building Universal City. _Damon and Pythias (1914)_ (qv) was Universal's first film completed there, just prior to the studio's official opening in March 1915 and, until 1925, Universal City would be the largest and most prolific studio in the world (eventually supplanted by MGM soon after its inception). Organized studio tours began in 1915 (they were discontinued in 1928 with the arrival of talkies, but resumed in 1964), which proved highly profitable. Laemmle, lacking a theater network, instituted a three-tiered branding system to market Universal's releases: Red Feather (low-budget), Bluebird (mainstream/medium budget) and Jewell (prestige releases, often roadshow attractions commanding premium prices). Heavy emphasis was placed on one-, two- and three-reel productions.  Universal became known as the most paternalistic of all the Hollywood studios. Virtually all of Uncle Carl's relatives (including his son 'Carl Laemmle Jr.' (qv) and his vastly more talented nephew, 'William Wyler' (qv), were employed there). The studio enjoyed enormous hits during the 1920s, especially 'Lon Chaney' (qv)'s _The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923/I)_ (qv) and _The Phantom of the Opera (1925)_ (qv) before the actor was lured away to MGM. Lacking a theater network, Universal concentrated on independent rural theatrical houses, offering affordable exhibitor's packages which allowed them to change bills numerous times per week. This marketing strategy largely concentrated on product that would appeal to rural theaters through 1930. During the 1920s Europe also became a major source of revenue, with Universal actively involved in co-productions overseas. Sound productions became the norm by 1929 and Universal responded by increasing the number of quality productions, scoring its first Academy Award for Best Picture with _All Quiet on the Western Front (1930)_ (qv) the following year. The studio became famous for popularizing the monster craze, beginning with _Dracula (1931)_ (qv), that remained strong into 1935. Unfortunately, the studio's other product was proving less successful as the ravages of the Depression took hold. Laemmle's emphasis on quality productions misfired in the mid-'30s and he was forced to take an unfavorable $750,000 loan from Standard Capital which, after cost overruns on the production of _Show Boat (1936)_ (qv), resulted in his ouster from the studio. He was forcibly retired from the movie industry in 1936 and sold Universal to Standard Capital Company, headed by 'Charles R. Rogers (I)' (qv), who instituted drastic cost-cutting measures that coincided with the signing of 'Deanna Durbin' (qv), whose popularity virtually single-handedly saved the studio from financial disaster from 1937-40, until other popular stars (notably the comedy team of 'Bud Abbott' (qv) and 'Lou Costello (I)' (qv)) were added to the studio's roster by a later management team headed by J. Cheever Cowdin. Universal was also--briefly--home to displaced low-budget veteran producers 'Trem Carr' (qv) and 'W. Ray Johnston' (qv), who worked there in 1936 while reforming Monogram Pictures after breaking off from an unhappy association with Republic Pictures.  While many contemporary observers disliked Rogers' handling of the so-called New Universal, the undeniable fact is that he saved the studio at a critical point in its history. Carl Laemmle died in 1939 of a heart attack in Los Angeles at age 72. As with most Hollywood studios, production boomed during WW2, and by 1945 the studio was averaging a release of one feature film per week. Universal merged with International Pictures, an independent studio headed by ex-20th Century-Fox executives 'William Goetz' (qv) and 'Leo Spitz' (qv) in 1946 and renamed Universal-International Pictures (reverted to Universal in 1963). Since the company had consciously avoided building a proprietary theater chain it was unaffected by the 1949 Supreme Court theater anti-trust decision. Indeed, the studio was actually better positioned than the other majors as it's revenue stream continued unabated. Universal was purchased by and merged with Decca Records in 1952.  While not a pioneer in television production (most majors, with the notable exception of Columbia, initially stonewalled it), the medium became a huge part of Universal City in the late 1950s. In 1962 Universal was purchased by and merged with The Music Corporation of America (MCA) and became MCA Universal. MCA's television production company, Revue Televsion Productions with its _Leave It to Beaver (1957)_ (qv) unit, would relocate to the sprawling Universal lot. Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. purchased MCA in 1991. The Seagram Co. purchased MCA in 1995 and MCA Universal was renamed Universal Studios. In 1998 Universal purchased the USA television network. The company merged with a French global media company, Vivendi Media Group, and became Vivendi Universal in 2000.

Kirk, commander of the starship U.S.S. Enterprise.  Shatner was born in Côte Saint-Luc, Montreal, Canada, to Anne (Garmaise) and Joseph Shatner, a clothing manufacturer. His father was a Jewish immigrant from Bukovina in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, while his maternal grandparents were Lithuanian Jews. After graduating from university he joined a local Summer theatre group as an assistant manager. He then performed with the National Repertory Theatre of Ottawa and at the Stratford, Ontario Shakespeare Festival as an understudy working with such as Alec Guinness, James Mason, and Anthony Quayle. He came to the attention of New York critics and was soon playing important roles on major shows in live television.  Shatner spent many years honing his craft before debuting alongside 'Yul Brynner (I)' (qv) in _The Brothers Karamazov (1958)_ (qv). He was kept busy during the 1960s in films such as _Judgment at Nuremberg (1961)_ (qv) and _The Intruder (1962)_ (qv) and on television guest-starring in dozens of series such as _Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955)_ (qv), _The Defenders (1961)_ (qv), _The Outer Limits (1963)_ (qv) and _The Twilight Zone (1959)_ (qv). In 1966, Shatner boarded the USS Enterprise for three seasons of _Star Trek (1966)_ (qv), co-starring alongside 'Leonard Nimoy' (qv), with the series eventually becoming a bona-fide cult classic with a worldwide legion of fans known as Trekkies.  After Star Trek folded, Shatner spent the rest of the decade and the 1970s making the rounds guest-starring on many prime-time television series, including _Hawaii Five-O (1968)_ (qv), _Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969)_ (qv) and _Ironside (1967)_ (qv). He has also appeared in several feature films, but they were mainly B-grade (or lower) fare such as the embarrassingly bad Euro western _Comanche blanco (1968)_ (qv) and the campy _Kingdom of the Spiders (1977)_ (qv). However, the 1980s saw a major resurgence in Shatner's career with the renewed interest in the original _Star Trek (1966)_ (qv) series culminating in a series of big-budget Star Trek feature films including _Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)_ (qv), _Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)_ (qv), _Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984)_ (qv), _Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986)_ (qv), _Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989)_ (qv) and _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)_ (qv). In addition, he starred in the lightweight police series _T.J. Hooker (1982)_ (qv) from 1982 to 1986, alongside spunky 'Heather Locklear' (qv), and surprised many fans with his droll comedic talents in _Airplane II: The Sequel (1982)_ (qv), _Loaded Weapon 1 (1993)_ (qv) and _Miss Congeniality (2000)_ (qv).  He has most recently been starring in the 'David E. Kelley (I)' (qv) television series _The Practice (1997)_ (qv) and its spin-off _Boston Legal (2004)_ (qv).

It has a scent and it is imperfect. If you get too close to the moving image, it's like impressionist art. And if you stand back, it can be utterly photo-realistic. You can watch the grain, which I like to think of as the visible, erratic molecules of a new creative language. After all, this stuff of dreams is mankind's most original medium, and dates back to 1895. Today, its years are numbered, but I will remain loyal to this analogue art-form until the last lab closes.", "[About the criticism he received for _The Color Purple (1985)_ (qv)] Most of the criticism came from directors that felt that we had overlooked them, and that it should have been a black director telling a black story. That was the main criticism. The other criticism was that I had softened the book. I have always copped to that. I made the movie I wanted to make from Alice Walker's book. Alice was on the set a lot of the time and could have always stepped forward to say, You know, this is too Disney. This is not the way I envisioned the scene going down. She was very supportive during filmmaking, and so I felt that we were doing a good job adapting her novel. There were certain things in the [lesbian] relationship between Shug Avery and Celie that were finely detailed in Alice's book, that I didn't feel could get a [PG-13] rating. And I was shy about it. In that sense, perhaps I was the wrong director to acquit some of the more sexually honest encounters between Shug and Celie, because I did soften those. I basically took something that was extremely erotic and very intentional, and I reduced it to a simple kiss. I got a lot of criticism for that.", "There are parts of _Hook (1991)_ (qv) I love.

I was ready to turn over a new leaf and Raiders was my chance to make a movie responsibly - under schedule and under budget. Fortunately 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) gave me a lot of support and help with preparation. I wasn't dreaming of big box office or making a classic; all I was focused on was making a film the audience would like and doing it in a way that was fiscally responsible. I think we were all surprised by the worldwide success of Raiders. I remember hearing people quote lines from the film or seeing kids pretend to be the characters, and realizing that the film had gone beyond box office success and had entered popular culture. That was one of the happy aftershocks of making that movie. More than anything, we want our films to be watchable and Raiders is a movie I can watch with my kids and completely detach myself from the fact that I directed it. I sit back and enjoy it. For a kid who grew up dreaming of making memorable images, it's a thrill to know Raiders is one of those films where people just have to see the silhouette of the main character, and they immediately think, Indiana Jones!", "[on 'Akira Kurosawa' (qv)] Kurosawa is the pictorial Shakespeare of our time.", "I'm very relaxed about Oscars.

Whatever happens, happens.", "I've had darkness in all the films, in _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv), _Jaws (1975)_ (qv). There are moments in _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv) that are brutally dark. I just don't think people have stopped to study. They may not have stopped to think when they assume that I suddenly developed a dark side because of _Schindler's List (1993)_ (qv). When critics carp about my dark side, I always wonder, Well, did they really look in the shadows?", "I committed to directing _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) principally because 'Frank Abagnale Jr.' (qv) did things that were the most astonishing scams I had ever heard. And I'm a big fan of scams. I loved _The Flim-Flam Man (1967)_ (qv). I loved _Scarecrow (1973)_ (qv) with 'Gene Hackman' (qv).

You know, some of those villains, you have to sympathize with them.", "In _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv) I had a sense that I was establishing a template, based on the experiences communicated to me by the veterans who fought that morning on Dog Green, Omaha Beach, and their experiences, and the very few surviving photographs of the great war correspondent, Robert Capa. I combined those photographs to try to find a 24-frame-per-second equivalent for how I can show that kind of terror and chaos without making a movie that looked elegant and beautiful and in full living color, very much like war movies had been made in the past. It wasn't that I was trying to break the mold of the old war movie approach, visually, but I was simply trying to validate all of this testimony that had been communicated to us, based on the young men that lived and survived that battle. I didn't know it was going to establish a look for war movies, but it was certainly what I thought was right for that particular story.", "[on working on _The Pacific (2010)_ (qv), _Band of Brothers (2001)_ (qv) and _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv)] - What moved us to tell these stories, based on these survivors and veterans, was to see what happens to the human soul throughout this particular engagement. These islands were stepping stones to the mainland of Japan. We weren't trained by the drill instructors stateside. We were trained by the enemy, in how to fight the enemy. They trained us how to fight like them. I don't want to compare one war to the other, in terms of savagery, but there's a level when nature and humanity conspire against the individual. To see what happens to those individuals, throughout the entire course of events, leading up to the dropping of the two atomic bombs, is something that was very, very hard for the actors, the writers and all of us to put on the screen, but we felt we had to try.", "There's no other way to learn about it, except through documentaries. I encourage documentarians to continue telling stories about World War II. I think documentaries are the greatest way to educate an entire generation that doesn't often look back to learn anything about the history that provided a safe haven for so many of us today. Documentaries are the first line of education, and the second line of education is dramatization, such as The Pacific.", "[on if the soldier's journey is the ultimate hero's journey] - For one thing, I don't think that anybody in any war thinks of themselves as a hero. The minute anybody presumes that they are heroes, they get their boots taken away from them and buried in the sand. That's not going to happen. In the re-creation of combat situations, and this is coming from a director who's never been in one, being mindful of what these veterans have actually gone through, you find that the biggest concern is that you don't look at war as a geopolitical endeavor. You look at war as something that is putting your best friend in jeopardy. You are responsible for the person in front of you and the person behind you, and the person to the left of you and the person to the right of you. Those are the small pods that will inadvertently create a hero, but that is someone else's observation, not the observation of those kids in the foxholes.", "[on 'Janusz Kaminski (I)' (qv)] I was watching television and saw his name on a TV movie, _Wildflower (1991) (TV)_ (qv), that was beautifully photographed, so I called up the head of my TV department and asked him to consider hiring him to do a pilot we produced about the Civil War, _Class of '61 (1993) (TV)_ (qv). The director agreed to use Janusz and he was great. I think Janusz has brought a lighting style to my movies that I'd never had before. Even 'Allen Daviau' (qv) who had done three pictures with me, who I think is the greatest lighting cameraman in town. But Janusz brought more daring, dangerous light into my films. I set the camera. I do all the blocking. I choose the lenses. I compose everything. But Janusz, basically, is my lighting guy. And he's a master painter with light; he's made tremendous contributions to my work through his art.", "I don't work weekends. Weekends are for my kids.

In telling a story, I will use every tool in my arsenal. I will do anything in my power to communicate the best story as I know how.", "My movies are all different. I've tried to make every movie as if it was made by a different director, because I'm very conscious of not wanting to impose a consistent style on subject matter that is not necessarily suited to that style. So I try to re-invent my own eye every time I tackle a new subject. But it's hard, because everybody has style. You can't help it. It just comes off you like pollen. I mean, if you're a bee, you're a bee, but at the same time I try very hard to work a little out of the box every time I make a choice. And I had to go back to a box that I had helped invent in the 1980s to accomplish the task of bringing Indiana Jones back to life in the 21st century. We went right back to the blazing Technicolor style of the first three installments. For _Munich (2005)_ (qv), I certainly tried to bring an early-70s Hollywood style, a cinéma-vérité style, with zoom-lenses, and a lot of the tools that were used to make movies in the 70s, one of my favorites being _The Day of the Jackal (1973)_ (qv), the 'Fred Zinnemann' (qv) film. But I didn't want to update Indiana Jones to the 1950s beyond hair, makeup, costumes and cars. I wanted it to look very similar to the first three pictures.", "I never know what I'm in for. Most of my presumptions about a production are usually wrong. For instance, with _Schindler's List (1993)_ (qv) I was pretty certain that whatever came my way in Poland I could tolerate, and just put my camera between myself and the subject, and protect myself by creating my own aesthetic distance. And immediately, on the first day of shooting, that broke down. I didn't have that as a safety net and immediately I realized that that this was about to become the most personal professional experience of my life. It was a devastatingly insightful experience, but it's something I still haven't gotten over. I think back on the production of Schindler's List with very sad memories, because of the subject matter, not because of the working experience. The working experience was nearly perfect because everybody held on to each other in that production. We formed a circle. It was very therapeutic, and for a lot of people, it changed their lives. A lot of the actors, a lot of the crew, it changed their lives. It changed my life, for sure. But other productions I've gone into with a blythe spirit, thinking, This film's a pushover. It's often when I take that attitude, the movie turns around and runs over me as if it were a tank. So I've tried my best to stop second-guessing what the working experience is going to be like. Because I'm usually wrong.", "The one ingredient I bring to all of my films is the ability to listen to anybody who has a good idea on the production. I'm very collaborative with actors, with my writers, with my editor, my cinematographer, with Johnny Williams who does all of my scores. And I just think from a very young age my parents taught me probably the most valuable lesson of my life - sometimes it's better not to talk, but to listen.", "I think most of my movies are personal movies. I think the most personal movie I've made is _Schindler's List (1993)_ (qv). I think the second-most personal movie I have ever made is _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv). I also find _The Color Purple (1985)_ (qv) to be a personal film for me. So I've made a number of personal films. But I haven't made a movie yet that is actually a mirror neuron of my factual life and I don't think I ever will. My sister wrote a script about our lives and that might come around again some day, but I've always stayed away from anything that is too biographical.", "[on 'James Cameron (I)' (qv)] He gets a lot of points for being a techno-brat, but he is a very emotional storyteller.", "I'm as guilty as anyone, because I helped to herald the digital era with _Jurassic Park (1993)_ (qv). But the danger is that it can be abused to the point where nothing is eye-popping any more. The difference between making _Jaws (1975)_ (qv) 31 years ago and _War of the Worlds (2005)_ (qv) is that today, anything I can imagine, I can realize on film. Then, when my mechanical shark was being repaired and I had to shoot something, I had to make the water scary. I relied on the audience's imagination, aided by where I put the camera. Today, it would be a digital shark. It would cost a hell of a lot more, but never break down. As a result, I probably would have used it four times as much, which would have made the film four times less scary. Jaws is scary because of what you don't see, not because of what you do. We need to bring the audience back into partnership with storytelling.", "What kept us going was the thought that 'David Lean (I)' (qv), at 54, had done this every day for a year.

All the things that Harrison, George, Larry Kasdan and I originally created. He brought all this back to life as if no time had elapsed since the third movie. My favourite memories from the shoot are my deepening respect for Harrison, not only as an actor but as a dear friend. We've gone off and made other movies which mean our paths have not crossed all that often.

Spielberg has countless big-grossing, critically acclaimed credits to his name, as producer, director and writer.  Steven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and 'Arnold Spielberg' (qv), an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. He gained notoriety as an uncredited assistant editor on the classic western _Wagon Train (1957)_ (qv). Among his early directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed _Escape to Nowhere (1961)_ (qv), which featured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister 'Anne Spielberg' (qv), and _The Last Gun (1959)_ (qv), a western. All of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed _Firelight (1964)_ (qv), a movie about aliens invading a small town. In 1967, he directed _Slipstream (1967)_ (qv), which was unfinished. However, in 1968, he directed _Amblin' (1968)_ (qv), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would feature so prominently. Amblin' also became the name of his production company, which turned out such classics as _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv). Spielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, _Duel (1971) (TV)_ (qv), with 'Dennis Weaver (I)' (qv). In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as 'Rod Serling' (qv)'s _Night Gallery (1969)_ (qv), _Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969)_ (qv) and _Columbo (1971) {Murder by the Book (#1.1)}_ (qv). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over the world.  Spielberg's first major directorial effort was _The Sugarland Express (1974)_ (qv), with 'Goldie Hawn' (qv), a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: _Jaws (1975)_ (qv). This classic shark attack tale started the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was credited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic _Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)_ (qv), a unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978, Spielberg produced his first film, the forgettable _I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978)_ (qv), and followed that effort with _Used Cars (1980)_ (qv), a critically acclaimed, but mostly forgotten, 'Kurt Russell (I)' (qv)\\'Jack Warden' (qv) comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more time with _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv), with 'Harrison Ford (I)' (qv) taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was _Poltergeist (1982)_ (qv), but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv). Spielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The concept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when Spielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or infamous) placement of Reece's Pieces in E.T. Spielberg was also one of the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like E.T. and Close Encounters, where a very strong emphasis on special effects was placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg followed up Raiders with _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)_ (qv), which was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim of its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in the 1980s, such as _The Goonies (1985)_ (qv), and was the brains behind the little monsters in _Gremlins (1984)_ (qv). He also produced the cartoon _An American Tail (1986)_ (qv), a quaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985, however, was the blockbuster _Back to the Future (1985)_ (qv), which made 'Michael J. Fox (I)' (qv) an instant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book _The Color Purple (1985)_ (qv), with 'Whoopi Goldberg' (qv) and 'Oprah Winfrey' (qv), with great success. In the latter half of the 1980s, he also directed _Empire of the Sun (1987)_ (qv), a mixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not escape him for long, though.  The late 1980s found Spielberg's projects at the center of pop-culture yet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film _Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)_ (qv). The next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he produced and directed _Always (1989)_ (qv) as well as _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)_ (qv), and _Back to the Future Part II (1989)_ (qv). All three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in 1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama _Dad (1989)_ (qv), with 'Jack Lemmon' (qv) and 'Ted Danson' (qv), which got mostly mixed results. Spielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong voice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark Who Framed Roger Rabbit, he produced the animated series _Tiny Toon Adventures (1990)_ (qv), _Animaniacs (1993)_ (qv), _Pinky and the Brain (1995)_ (qv), _Freakazoid! (1995)_ (qv), _Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain (1998)_ (qv), _Family Dog (1993)_ (qv) and _Toonsylvania (1998)_ (qv). Spielberg also produced other cartoons such as _The Land Before Time (1988)_ (qv), _We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993)_ (qv), _Casper (1995)_ (qv) (the live action version) as well as the live-action version of _The Flintstones (1994)_ (qv), where he was credited as Steven Spielrock. Spielberg also produced many Roger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s, as he directed _Hook (1991)_ (qv) and produced such films as the cute fantasy _Joe Versus the Volcano (1990)_ (qv) and _An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991)_ (qv). He also produced the unusual comedy thriller _Arachnophobia (1990)_ (qv), _Back to the Future Part III (1990)_ (qv) and _Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990)_ (qv). While these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not quite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous efforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed _Jurassic Park (1993)_ (qv), which for a short time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time, but did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big box-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced and directed _Schindler's List (1993)_ (qv), a stirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars, and also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the production company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many box-office successes.  As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such films as _The Mask of Zorro (1998)_ (qv), _Men in Black (1997)_ (qv) and _Deep Impact (1998)_ (qv). However, it was on the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and produced the epic _Amistad (1997)_ (qv), a spectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to the fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997. The next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best films of his career: _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), a film about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect. It was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to _Shakespeare in Love (1998)_ (qv).  Spielberg produced a series of films, including _Evolution (2001)_ (qv), _The Haunting (1999)_ (qv) and _Shrek (2001)_ (qv). he also produced two sequels to _Jurassic Park (1993)_ (qv), which were financially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he produced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a financial and critical success: _Band of Brothers (2001)_ (qv), a tale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the invasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was back in the director's chair for _Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001)_ (qv), a movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box office and garnered varied reviews from critics.  Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series _Seaquest DSV (1993)_ (qv), an anthology series entitled _Amazing Stories (1985)_ (qv), created the video-game series Medal of Honor set during World War Two, and was a starting producer of _ER (1994)_ (qv). Spielberg, if you haven't noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and 'Tom Hanks' (qv) collaborated on _Shooting War (2000) (TV)_ (qv), a documentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called _A Holocaust szemei (2000)_ (qv). With all of this to Spielberg's credit, it's no wonder that he's looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment."], "birthnotes": ["Cincinnati, Ohio, USA"], "birthdate": ["18 December 1946"], "height": ["5' 7 1/2"], "spouse": ["'Amy Irving (I)' (qv) (27 November 1985 - 2 February 1989) (divorced); 1 child", "'Kate Capshaw' (qv) (12 October 1991 - present); 5 children"], "otherworks": ["(July 2014) TV commercial with 'Oprah Winfrey' (qv), 'Steven Spielberg' (qv), 'Helen Mirren (I)' (qv), 'Lasse Hallström' (qv), and others for _The Hundred-Foot Journey (2014)_ (qv).", "Wrote the liner notes for the 'Michael Jackson (I)' (qv) album HIStory", "Wrote foreword for My Magic Carpet of Films: A Personal Journey in the Motion Picture Industry, 1916-2000 by 'Michael D.

Both are the children of feuding families. Pyramus, like Romeo, is led to believe that she has died, and stabs himself to be with her. Thisbe then follows suit. Romeo & Juliet was later a partial inspiration for the play Cyrano de Bergerac. Both begin with a duel, and feature an iconic balcony scene. When Cyrano insults his own nose, he ends with And finally, parodying Pyramus's cries, 'Behold the nose that destroyed the beauty of it's master features.

Because the names had been altered, Hamilton's identification of the play with Cardenio has been controversial, but has not been refuted.

Many scholars took that to be an insult, but this interpretation is incorrect. In 17th-century England, a home's best bed was reserved for guests; a husband and wife slept in the second-best one. Shakespeare's gesture was a sentimental reminder of the love he bore his wife."], "minibiography": ["William Shakespeare's birthdate is assumed from his baptism on April 25. His father John was the son of a farmer who became a successful tradesman; his mother Mary Arden was gentry. He studied Latin works at Stratford Grammar School, leaving at about age 15. About this time his father suffered an unknown financial setback, though the family home remained in his possession. An affair with Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior and a nearby farmer's daughter, led to pregnancy and a hasty marriage late in 1582. Susanna was born in May of 1583, twins Hamnet and Judith in January of 1585. By 1592 he was an established actor and playwright in London though his career path afterward (fugitive? butcher? soldier? actor?) is highly debated. When plague closed the London theatres for two years he apparently toured; he also wrote two long poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He may have spent this time at the estate of the Earl of Southampton. By December 1594 he was back in London as a member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, the company he stayed with the rest of his life. In 1596 he seems to have purchased a coat of arms for his father; the same year Hamnet died at age 11. The following year he purchased the grand Stratford mansion New Place. A 1598 edition of Love's Labors was the first to bear his name, though he was already recognized as England's greatest playwright. He is believed to have written his Sonnets during the 1590s.

Acting in and writing for talent shows and school plays was simply a small town passion until I graduated from Ferris State University. After earning a degree in Marketing Shawn left the next day to pursue his dream as an actor by relocating to Chicago where he honed his acting skills with a variety of acting coaches and styles. He began to find his true voice with the improvisational company Improv Olympic. Just as he was about to begin Second City in Chicago Shawn got his first big break portraying working class anti-hero 'Mike Kasnoff' on the New York-based CBS daytime drama As The World Turns. After a three year run he took the leap to Los Angeles. He landed recurring roles on ABC's Boston Legal as delinquent husband to Julie Bowen and wily journalist on NBC's Crossing Jordan and nemesis to Josh Duhamel on Las Vegas. He returned to his comic roots with a roles on the HBO series 12 Miles of Bad Road, Friends, Will and Grace, The Drew Carey Show, Ellen, Becker, and Coupling. Shawn experienced more than a few failed pilots and shows until he starred opposite Lori Loughlin in The WB's hit series Summerland and opposite Jami Gertz and Tyne Daly in the CBS hit movie Undercover Christmas. Additional television work includes starring opposite Paige Turco in the NBC hit family movie Secrets of the Mountain, C.S.I., and Shark with James Woods, as well as lead roles in John Woo's action drama pilot Red Skies for USA and quirky spy comedy Spy Girl opposite Jennie Garth for NBC. Shawn was excited to delve into darker characters in the role of convicted killer Danny Pelosi in Murder in the Hamptons and dangerous con man in Ghost Whisperer. Shawn started picking up film roles in Christopher Guest's feature film For Your Consideration, Shopgirl with Claire Danes directed by Steve Martin, How To Leave Your Lover, Almost You, and Beautiful, with Minnie Driver directed by Sally Field. Shawn appears in a supporting role in Eddie Murphy's film Meet Dave and stars as the lead in the cult franchise hit Tremors III as the offbeat Zen cowboy Jack Sawyer.  Shawn Executive Produced, Co-Directed and starred in the independent film Spanners, which won the award for BEST SCI-FI film at the 2015 Hollywood Independent Reel Film Festival, and BEST ACTOR at the 2015 Hollywood Underground Film Festival. He stars opposite Chris Pine, Oscar nominee John Hawks and Oscar winner Octavio Spencer in Small Town Saturday Night. Shawn just finished a long run as 'Dr. Daniel Jonas' on NBC's Days of Our Lives.

As a small child, he and his family moved to nearby Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where his parents opened up a french restaurant. During his teen years, Hensley toiled at many jobs in the restaurant, from cook to busboy. Finally, after growing tired of the restaurant business, he left for New York University to study journalism. He had registered late, and because of that, he didn't have a dorm space. He stayed at the YMCA and had the unsettling experience of having to share a bathroom with someone he didn't know. He also frequently heard drunks, etc. moaning on the streets, all the while wondering, What am I doing here?. One night, while at a night club, he met a woman who told him he should try acting. Hensley thought it would be something he could do and enjoy. This woman, who would eventually become his manager, sent him out on an audition for _Another World (1964)_ (qv). Although he didn't snag the part, Hensley did land the role of Brody Price on _One Life to Live (1968)_ (qv) a few months later. After being let go by that soap, Hensley next landed the role that turned him into a soap superstar: Holden Snyder of _As the World Turns (1956)_ (qv). From the onset, it seemed that all the writers were interested in was pairing his character with 'Martha Byrne (I)' (qv)'s Lily. Hensley, wanting to do something different, left the show in 1988 for London, England, where he studied at the Shakespeare Academy of Music, Drama and Art. In 1990, Hensley contacted ATWT, expressing an interest in returning. With 'Martha Byrne (I)' (qv) now gone, it seemed like a perfect opportunity for Hensley to spread his wings. However, the show recast the character of Lily with 'Heather Rattray' (qv), and again Holden was paired with Lily. This version proved unpopular with fans, and by late 1992, the show broke the couple up after giving Holden amnesia. In 1993, 'Martha Byrne (I)' (qv) returned, and Hensley's character was being written as being obsessed with Lily. By early 1995, Hensley had had enough and left again. During this hiatus, he starred in _Wounded Heart (1995) (TV)_ (qv), _Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990)_ (qv) and _Almost Perfect (1995)_ (qv). But, perhaps his most important role was yet to come: Husband. On May 25, 1996, he married former ATWT co-star 'Kelley Menighan Hensley' (qv) in Chicago. Late that year, ATWT learned that Jon Hensley was in talks to sign with _All My Children (1970)_ (qv) as Jake Martin. Knowing they had to move fast if they wanted him, ATWT offered Hensley his Holden Snyder role again. On December 4, 1996, Jon Hensley signed a 3-year deal with ATWT. Throughout this 3-year contract period, there were moments when the show wasn't focused on pairing him with Lily, but only for about three weeks. The rest of the time, his character was paired with Lily. One bright spot in Hensley's family life, however, was that on December 23, 1998, Hensley and his wife Kelley had their first child, Sophie May. As Hensley's contract expired in late 1999, the buzz in the industry was that Hensley would leave again. Surprisingly, Hensley re-signed for three more years, due in part to ATWT hiring a new executive producer, 'Christopher Goutman' (qv), a man with a proven track record of excellence. Hensley had said upon re-signing that he was confident that Goutman would give his character a sense of direction. However, with two years left on his contract, it is very apparent that ATWT is content on keeping him paired with 'Martha Byrne (I)' (qv). I predict, and hope, that if ATWT keeps this up, that by the end of 2002, Hensley will leave once again, this time for good."], "birthnotes": ["Browns Mills, New Jersey, USA"], "birthdate": ["26 August 1965"], "height": ["6'"], "spouse": ["'Kelley Menighan Hensley' (qv) (25 May 1996 - present); 3 children"], "nicknames": ["Jonny"], "magazinecoverphoto": ["Soap Opera Weekly (USA), 28 October 1997, Vol. 8, Iss. 43"] } }

But he got the reputation because, in the 1940s, he got himself allied with a group called the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, which was an anti-Communist and anti-Semitic organization. And though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic, and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life. Disney ultimately distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.

He had Irish, German, and English ancestry. Walt moved with his parents to Kansas City at age seven, where he spent the majority of his childhood. At age 16, during World War I, he faked his age to join the American Red Cross. He soon returned home, where he won a scholarship to the Kansas City Art Institute. There, he met a fellow animator, 'Ub Iwerks' (qv). The two soon set up their own company. In the early 1920s, they made a series of animated shorts for the Newman theater chain, entitled Newman's Laugh-O-Grams. Their company soon went bankrupt, however.  The two then went to Hollywood in 1923. They started work on a new series, about a live-action little girl who journeys to a world of animated characters. Entitled the Alice Comedies, they were distributed by 'M.J. Winkler' (qv) (Margaret). Walt was backed up financially only by Winkler and his older brother 'Roy O. Disney' (qv), who remained his business partner for the rest of his life. Hundreds of Alice Comedies were produced between 1923 and 1927, before they lost popularity.  Walt then started work on a series around a new animated character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. This series was successful, but in 1928, Walt discovered that 'M.J. Winkler' (qv) and her husband, 'Charles Mintz' (qv), had stolen the rights to the character away from him. They had also stolen all his animators, except for 'Ub Iwerks' (qv). While taking the train home, Walt started doodling on a piece of paper. The result of these doodles was a mouse named Mickey. With only Walt and Ub to animate, and Walt's wife 'Lillian Disney' (qv) (Lilly) and Roy's wife 'Edna Disney' (qv) to ink in the animation cells, three Mickey Mouse cartoons were quickly produced. The first two didn't sell, so Walt added synchronized sound to the last one, _Steamboat Willie (1928)_ (qv), and it was immediately picked up. With Walt as the voice of Mickey, it premiered to great success. Many more cartoons followed. Walt was now in the big time, but he didn't stop creating new ideas.  In 1929, he created the 'Silly Symphonies', a cartoon series that didn't have a continuous character. They were another success. One of them, _Flowers and Trees (1932)_ (qv), was the first cartoon to be produced in color and the first cartoon to win an Oscar; another, _Three Little Pigs (1933)_ (qv), was so popular it was often billed above the feature films it accompanied. The Silly Symphonies stopped coming out in 1939, but Mickey and friends, (including Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, and plenty more), were still going strong and still very popular.  In 1934, Walt started work on another new idea: a cartoon that ran the length of a feature film. Everyone in Hollywood was calling it Disney's Folly, but _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)_ (qv) was anything but, winning critical raves, the adoration of the public, and one big and seven little special Oscars for Walt. Now Walt listed animated features among his ever-growing list of accomplishments. While continuing to produce cartoon shorts, he also started producing more of the animated features. _Pinocchio (1940)_ (qv), _Dumbo (1941)_ (qv), and _Bambi (1942)_ (qv) were all successes; not even a flop like _Fantasia (1940)_ (qv) and a studio animators' strike in 1941 could stop Disney now.  In the mid 1940s, he began producing packaged features, essentially a group of shorts put together to run feature length, but by 1950 he was back with animated features that stuck to one story, with _Cinderella (1950)_ (qv), _Alice in Wonderland (1951)_ (qv), and _Peter Pan (1953)_ (qv). In 1950, he also started producing live-action films, with _Treasure Island (1950)_ (qv). These began taking on greater importance throughout the 50s and 60s, but Walt continued to produce animated features, including _Lady and the Tramp (1955)_ (qv), _Sleeping Beauty (1959)_ (qv), and _One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)_ (qv).  In 1955, he even opened a theme park in southern California: Disneyland. It was a place where children and their parents could take rides, just explore, and meet the familiar animated characters, all in a clean, safe environment. It was another great success. Walt also became one of the first producers of films to venture into television, with his series _Disneyland (1954)_ (qv) which he began in 1954 to promote his theme park. He also produced _The Mickey Mouse Club (1955)_ (qv) and _Zorro (1957)_ (qv). To top it all off, Walt came out with the lavish musical fantasy _Mary Poppins (1964)_ (qv), which mixed live-action with animation. It is considered by many to be his magnum opus. Even after that, Walt continued to forge onward, with plans to build a new theme park and an experimental prototype city in Florida.  He never did finish those plans, however; in 1966, he developed lung cancer brought on by his lifelong chain-smoking. He died in the hospital on December 15, 1966 at age 65. But not even his death, it seemed, could stop him. Roy carried on plans to build the Florida theme park, and it premiered in 1971 under the name Walt Disney World. What's more, his company continues to flourish, still producing animated and live-action films and overseeing the still- growing empire started by one man: Walt Disney, who will never be forgotten."], "birthnotes": ["Chicago, Illinois, USA"], "birthdate": ["5 December 1901"], "height": ["5' 10"], "deathdate": ["15 December 1966"], "spouse": ["'Lillian Disney' (qv) (13 July 1925 - 15 December 1966) (his death); 2 children"], "otherworks": ["(1 January 1966) Grand Marshal, Tournament of Roses parade"], "birthname": ["Disney, Walter Elias"], "salaryhistory": ["_One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)_ (qv)::$5,166/week", "_Swiss Family Robinson (1960)_ (qv)::$3,000/week"], "nicknames": ["Uncle Walt"], "books": ["Charles Solomon. _The Disney That Never Was: The Stories and Art from Five Decades of Unproduced Animation._ New York: Hyperion Books, 1995.", "Charles Shows. _Walt: Backstage Adventures With Walt Disney._ La Jolla, CA: Windsong Books, 1979.", "Diane Disney Miller. _The Story of Walt Disney._ New Rochelle, NY: Henry Holt, 1957.", "Russell Merrit, J.B.

After graduating, he moved to New York to pursue a career in acting, but soon found himself back in Chicago and working as a copy-writer for the advertising agency McCann Erickson. It was there that he met fellow Chicagoan and young copy-writer, 'William J. Bell' (qv), who would later create the two most successful daytime dramas in television history. Birn and Bell worked side by side creating ad slogans and writing jingle copy. When Bell moved on to begin his career in daytime, Birn stayed back and forged a successful thirty-year career in the advertising world. After his stint at McCann Erickson, Birn went to work for Tatham, Laird & Kudner, in Chicago and New York, where he created some of the most unforgettable characters and slogans in the history of commercials. Birn's client list included Mr. Clean, Head & Shoulders, Kix and Trix Cereal, Tidy Bowl, Lucky Strike Cigarettes and Biz and Bold detergents. Birn was the very first person to obtain permission from the elusive Walt Disney to allow a product to use a Disney character in an ad, when he introduced the animated Peter Pan and Captain Hook for Peter Pan Peanut Butter. Birn retired as Chairman of the Board of Tatham, Laird & Kudner in 1984. In 1987, Birn was contacted by his longtime friend William J. Bell, who by now was living in Los Angeles and helming his creations The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful. Birn quickly packed his bags and again found himself working side by side with Bell, but this time writing soap operas. For the next 22 years, until shortly before his death, Birn served as a writer and a story consultant for the two critically acclaimed dramas. During this time Birn garnered 20 Daytime Emmy nominations and three Emmys as well as three Writer's Guild Award nominations and one Writer's Guild Award.

It's iconic the character he's created and it's so much fun to be part of an iconic series.", "[on her career] I've been performing since I came out of the womb.

She's been through a lot, and that's why she's so guarded and mysterious.", "[on trying to get involved in independent film] You know, it's been really difficult for me a long time. I got my start doing studio films so I've worked my way backwards in a way because I always wanted to do independent films but I got my start in these genre horror-type things, and those were the people that noticed me. The independent world didn't really notice me, so it's been a real struggle trying to break into this sort of thing.

At 23, she left Australia for the UK to pursue an acting career and further stage training, but found the competition so great that she ended up working for Kellogg's, and soon returned. Unfortunately, her life was plagued with ill health, and she suffered a heart attack in 1979; underwent heart operations in 1982 and '83. Further complications were stomach cancer and kidney problems in 1996, and a major hip operation. She made her name on TV in 'Sons and Daughters', 'Prisoner' and 'Playschool', and of course on the stage. Without doubt her greatest contribution to acting was her portrayal of Helen Daniels - glamorous mother-in-law, grandmother and great-grandmother, and Grundy TV's 'Neighbours' matriarch. From the show's inception in 1985, she played an intelligent and sympathetic character with whom every other character was able to talk and discuss their problems. Haddy saw cast members come and go, becoming the longest-serving member of the cast in 1993 after the departure of Alan Dale. She was also able to enjoy working with her real-life husband James Condon, who played the guest parts of both Douglas Blake and Reuben White on the show. Her character's life often mirrored her own, with Helen suffering ill health throughout the 12 years of her time on the show. In 1997, Haddy's poor health forced her to take time off from the show. When doctors told her that she had narrowly avoided death from stomach cancer that year, she made the difficult decision to quit, and Helen Daniels died peacefully with her family around her in Episode 2,965 in October 1997. Sadly, Anne continued to experience ill health, and died peacefully with her husband beside her in a Melbourne hospital in July 1999.

In later years, she gained significant visibility on TV, particularly as an emotive, but well-meaning and strong-minded presence on various daytime soapers.  Born on March 21, 1939, in Wilmington, Delaware, Kathleen is the daughter of Eugene Widdoes and his wife, Bernice Delapo. She attended high school there and made her professional stage debut as Alma in Bus Stop at age 18 at the Robin Hood Playhouse in Wilmington. She then toured Canada in the role of Catherine in A View from the Bridge and played roles in Ondine and The Lark on Canadian TV. Additionally, she studied mime at the Université au Théâtre des Nations in Paris, and attended the Sorbonne in Paris on a Fulbright Scholarship, where she completed her theatrical studies.  Moving to New York to pursue her career, Kathleen blossomed into one of the loveliest and most talented classical ingénues around, gaining valuable experience and acclaim on- and off-Broadway in such plays as The World of Suzie Wong (understudying 'France Nuyen' (qv)), The Three Sisters (1959), The Idiot (1960) and The Maids (1963). Moreover, she earned glowing reviews in works of the Bard, most notably for 'Joseph Papp' (qv) and his New York Shakespeare Festival. Her early Shakespeare work included Henry V (1960), Measure for Measure (1960), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1961), Richard II (1962) and The Tempest (1962).  TV audiences first caught sight of her talent in a regular role on the soapy medical drama _Young Dr. Malone (1958)_ (qv) and, as Emily Webb in a prestigious production of _Art Carney Special (1959) {Our Town (#1.2)}_ (qv) which also starred 'Art Carney' (qv). The rest of the 1960s was predominantly theater-oriented; however, she did make an impressive film debut as one of _The Group (1966)_ (qv), alongside fellow newcomers 'Candice Bergen (I)' (qv), 'Joanna Pettet' (qv), 'Hal Holbrook' (qv) and 'Joan Hackett' (qv), and appeared prominently in _Petulia (1968)_ (qv) and 'Anton Chekhov' (qv)'s _The Sea Gull (1968)_ (qv). The 1970s proved to be the pinnacle of Kathleen's stage career capped by her Obie award-winning performance as Polly Peacham in The Beggar's Opera in 1972 and a Tony nomination the following year for her vibrant Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing, a role preserved for TV. Adding to her Bard stature that decade was her bravura work as Desdemona, Juliet, Titania, Viola and Mariana.  In 1978, Kathleen began showing up on daytime drama. She scored big points as young 'Ray Liotta' (qv)'s emotional and careworn Italian mom, Rose Perini, on _Another World (1964)_ (qv) from 1978-1980, and also had a subsequent role on _Ryan's Hope (1975)_ (qv) before establishing herself with the role of benevolent advice-giver Emma Snyder in _As the World Turns (1956)_ (qv), a role she has played since November of 1985, earning four daytime Emmy nominations in the process.  In all that time, Kathleen has maintained a strong profile in the New York theater scene. Credits have included The Importance of Being Earnest, 'Neil Simon (I)' (qv)'s Brighton Beach Memoirs, the revival of You Can't Take It With You and Hamlet (twice playing Gertrude). She won a second Obie Award for Tower of Evil in 1990, and was awarded the 'Lucille Lortel (I)' (qv) Award for her outstanding participation in Franny's Way (2002). More recently, she appeared in a revival of 'Noël Coward' (qv)'s After the Ball (2004), a musical version of 'Oscar Wilde (I)' (qv)'s Lady Windemere's Fan.  Along with her As the World Turn duties in New York, Kathleen has been seen on TV in episodes of _Oz (1997)_ (qv) (recurring), and _Law & Order (1990)_ (qv), among others.

They lived on Dufferin Avenue in London Ontario Canada. After George's sudden death, Mary rented spare rooms in their home to boarders to make ends meet. Letting to day laborers and theater players was a good source of income for this Victorian single mother. Al became fascinated with the theater and left his position as a clerk in a Biscuit Manufactory to pursue his theatrical career, at the age of 20, as a stagehand and carpenter for the London (Ontario) Opera House. By the time he left the Opera House, he had attained the position of stage manager. In 1909, he began to work with David Horsley at the Nestor Film Company directing comedies and westerns in Bayonne, New Jersey, Staten Island, New York and Baltimore, Maryland. The flip of a nickel landed Christie, a small troupe of players and directors and a train car load of equipment to Hollywood; as Horsley thought Florida would be the ideal place to film under sunny skies, Christie thought California better suited to their industry and quite a bit further from the process servers that were chasing producers who were supposed to be using cameras controlled by the Motion Picture Patents Company. Heads-Florida, tails-California. Al won the toss. Shortly after arriving in Los Angeles, Christie, while accompanied by a real estate agent,and an assistant, spied the Blondeau Tavern at the corner of Sunset and Gower. The Maier Brewing Company who was the lessee at the time, rented it to Christie for $30.00 a month. The following day, October 27, 1911, saw the opening of the first studio in Hollywood California. During the next few months, Christie was incredibly busy turning the tavern into a viable studio and meeting his weekly short. On January 17, 1912, Christie and his wife, Nora, welcomed their only child, Lenora Shirley Christie to Los Angeles. The Nestor Company eventually merged with Universal Films and by the time Universal City was built in 1915, Mr. Christie came on board as the head of the comedy department. By the middle of 1916, Christie left Universal and returned to the Sunset and Gower location which became the home of Christie Film Company, incorporating on June 15,1917 with Charles Christie (brother), Al Christie, Mary Christie (mother), Fred Porter and Kenyon Lee to serve as the Trustees for the corporation. The Christie brothers built their empire specializing in two-reel comedies, and as the industry grew, full-length features. 1918 was a difficult personal year for both of the Christie brothers. Charles lost Edna, his wife of nearly 16 years, following a surgery to repair a chronic ulcer. She died July 16, 1918. They never had any children and Charles never re-married. Meanwhile, Al wrote and/or directed titles like: Know Thy Wife, All Mixed Up, Why Husbands Flirt and Why Get A Divorce? The names of these scenarios and shorts were mirroring his own marriage. By September, when Al registered for the draft during World War I, he and Nora had split. He was living at 6680 Sunset, and she was living at the Hotel Savoy at the corner of Sixth and Grand.

He has won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, three as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his 2,000 Year Old Man album, based on his comedy routine with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv).  Reiner was born in The Bronx, to Bessie (Mathias) and Irving Reiner, a watchmaker. His father was an Austrian Jewish immigrant and his mother was a Romanian Jewish immigrant. At the age of sixteen, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.  In the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in _New Faces of 1937 (1937)_ (qv), but that is unlikely as he would have only been 15-years-old at the time. (Interesting, that movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv)' 1968 classic, _The Producers (1967)_ (qv), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his angels by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn't appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his TV debut in 1948 in the short-lived TV series, _The Fashion Story (1948)_ (qv), then became a regular, the following year, on _The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue (1949), another TV series with a brief life.  Reiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical Inside U.S.A., a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the 1950 musical revue, Alive and Kicking, was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. 'Max Liebman' (qv), the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show's troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn't help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.  Leibman was a producer-director on _Your Show of Shows (1950)_ (qv), one of the great TV series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner's first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing The Professor, a character played by 'Sid Caesar' (qv). He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, Your Show of Shows was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in _Caesar's Hour (1954)_ (qv). ('Imogene Coca' (qv) was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produced specials).  Your Show or Shows had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young 'Bob Fosse' (qv)) whereas Caesar's Hour was pure comedy. Your Show of Shows had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, 'Howard Morris (I)' (qv), and 'Nanette Fabray' (qv) (who went on to win an Emmy) moved over to Caesar's Hour. In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both Your Show of Shows and Caesar's Hour. In addition to 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv), the writing staff included 'Neil Simon (I)' (qv), his brother 'Danny Simon (I)' (qv), 'Larry Gelbart' (qv) and 'Mel Tolkin' (qv). (There are rumors that the young 'Woody Allen' (qv) served as the writing staff's typist).  Reiner had sat in informally with the writers during Your Show of Shows, but he began writing formally for Caesar's Hour, having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited writer without portfolio, he was able to leave writers' meetings at 6 PM, if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.  In 1959, he created the pilot for a TV series, Man of the House, in which he would play a writer, Rob Petrie, who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after 'Sid Caesar' (qv) (a benign despot who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on Your Show of Shows and Caesar's Hour. The network didn't pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner's part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with 'Mel Brooks (I)' (qv) on _The Steve Allen Show (1956)_ (qv), and their routine The 2000 Year Old Man was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated TV special based on their shtick in 1975.  Though CBS turned down Man of the House, with the two-time Emmy-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a WASP in the role of Rob Petrie to ensure the broad appeal of the show, and the casting of the protagonist came down to 'Johnny Carson (I)' (qv) and 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv). Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie (1963)_ (qv), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the part and another chapter of TV history was made, when 'Mary Tyler Moore' (qv), 'Rose Marie (I)' (qv) and 'Morey Amsterdam' (qv) all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of Alan Brady, the abrasive 'Sid Caesar' (qv)-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series' five-year run.  Another milestone in TV comedy, _The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961)_ (qv), brought Reiner five more Emmies, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer 'Sheldon Leonard' (qv) and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmies as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of Alan Brady on _Mad About You (1992)_ (qv), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  It was on The Dick Van Dyke Show that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play 'Joseph Stein' (qv) had adapted from his 1958 novel, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv). His work as a writer-director, with 'Dick Van Dyke' (qv), in creating a 'Stan Laurel' (qv)-type character in _The Comic (1969)_ (qv) was not a success, but _Where's Poppa? (1970)_ (qv) became a cult classic and _Oh, God! (1977)_ (qv), with 'George Burns (I)' (qv), and _The Jerk (1979)_ (qv), with 'Steve Martin (I)' (qv), were smash hits. The last movie he directed was the 1997 comedy, _That Old Feeling (1997)_ (qv).  Reiner's career has continued on into the 21st Century, when most of his contemporaries had retired. He was awarded the 'Mark Twain' (qv) Prize for American Humor in 2000 and, starting in 2001, he acted in the remake of _Ocean's Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its two sequels. Most recently, he has appeared as a voice artist in the animated series, _The Cleveland Show (2009)_ (qv) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his Your Show of Shows experience) and has appeared as a regular on the TV series, _Hot in Cleveland (2010)_ (qv) (with fellow nonagenarian 'Betty White (I)' (qv)), as well as appeared on an episode of _Parks and Recreation (2009)_ (qv) in 2012."], "birthnotes": ["The Bronx, New York City, New York, USA"], "birthdate": ["20 March 1922"], "height": ["6' 1"], "spouse": ["'Estelle Reiner' (qv) (24 December 1943 - 25 October 2008) (her death); 3 children"], "otherworks": ["(1973) Unsold pilot: Produced / directed a sitcom pilot for NBC called Where's Mama.
